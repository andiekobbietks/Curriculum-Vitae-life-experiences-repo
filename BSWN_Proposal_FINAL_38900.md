## Understanding the UnMuseum Vision

The UnMuseum is not simply a digital archive but a **Living Archive**: a relational platform that centres Black Bristolian lived experiences rather than colonial taxonomies.

### Decolonial Archiving Approach

Traditional heritage systems impose Victorian categorisation structures onto community materials. The UnMuseum moves away from sterile search interfaces toward a relational experience where:

- **Stories navigate to other stories** through emotional, thematic, and geographic connections
- **Community members co-curate** rather than passive consumption
- **Dublin Core metadata** supports interoperability without imposing hierarchy
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** ensures accessibility for all community members

### Technical Architecture

The platform will utilise Omeka S as the foundation, enhanced with:

- Custom semantic relationship modules
- ElevenLabs voice preservation integration (Impact Program for nonprofits)
- RAG-enabled conversational discovery layer
- Self-hosted infrastructure maintaining full data sovereignty

## About Andrea Enning

### Technical Expertise

I bring direct experience in heritage technology through my work developing the FirstGens Airtable system, which secured **USW Widening Participation funding** and enabled data-driven impact reporting for their first published Impact Report (2023-2024).

My First Class dissertation at the University of South Wales focused on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture**, directly applicable to the UnMuseum conversational discovery features.

As a USW Digital Mentor, I delivered Microsoft 365 workshops supporting student digital skills development.

### Subject Matter Expertise: Intercultural Heritage

I offer unique academic credentials for this heritage project:

- **Published Researcher**: Featured as "Giovanni" in Dr Simone Varriale's peer-reviewed article "Meritocracy, Recognition and Double Consciousness: Why Black and Muslim Italians Move to (and Sometimes Leave) Post-Brexit Britain" (*British Journal of Sociology*, November 2025)

- **Marie Curie Research Subject**: Participant in the MIDIC project (EU Horizon 2020, Grant Agreements 841716/874979), examining Italian diaspora experiences in the UK

- **Intercultural Competence Connection**: Research conducted by Dr Annavittoria Sarli, Marie Curie Fellow at the University of Birmingham (2020-2022), who now teaches Intercultural Communication at the University of Parma

- **Media Feature**: Interviewed for Italics Magazine "Being Afro-European" series (July 2022), discussing identity and belonging as a Black Italian in Britain

This lived experience and academic engagement directly informs my approach to heritage platforms that centre marginalised narratives authentically.

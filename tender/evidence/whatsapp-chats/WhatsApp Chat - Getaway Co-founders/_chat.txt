[12/05/2025, 18:21:23] Fizzy: Hi guys, sorry I was MIA last week. I got pretty swamped travelling to Wales and doing a bunch of other things
[12/05/2025, 18:22:30] Fizzy: Some updates:
I created the flowchart we spoke about last monday. You can find it here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVI2tNOyQ=/
[12/05/2025, 18:23:15] Fizzy: @⁨Andie⁩ I also created the shell for the frontend jira project: https://getawayai.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1
[12/05/2025, 18:26:28] Fizzy: I spent some time last week working on the get_flight_location_id tool bug (https://getawayai.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-1). I haven’t been able to figure out what’s wrong yet, but it seems there is some caching going on, cos I completely took out the model that was having the problem and I am still getting the same error. I’ll spend some more time tomorrow looking at it further
[12/05/2025, 18:26:31] Andie: thanks so much I just accepted it and will be reviewing it soon, mostly likely between tonight and very early morning

[14/05/2025, 11:42:11] Andie: since u guys are meeting today, wanted you to check for yourself and let me know what you thought, not sure how much this has been on your radar but obvs it has a lot to learn from even if a lot of the stuff @⁨Fizzy⁩ you are implementing is headless agents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K27diMbCsuw
[14/05/2025, 11:45:55] Andie: *Context*: In software/AI, a "headless agent" would typically mean an agent that operates without a user-facing interface or presentation layer-serving only as an API or backend logic that can be consumed by any client. ‎<This message was edited>
[14/05/2025, 11:46:44] Andie: *Technical Parallels:* In the context of a headless CMS, "headless" refers to a strict separation between the backend (content/data management) and the frontend (presentation/UI). The backend exposes data purely via APIs, and any frontend or consumer can use that data independently - in case you both are familiar with Content Management Systems like Wordpress and what have you ‎<This message was edited>
[14/05/2025, 11:47:20] Andie: Manus AI is an autonomous AI agent that can execute complex tasks, integrate with tools, and process multi-modal data (text, images, code)
[14/05/2025, 11:47:41] Andie: it is an agent with a defined set of capabilities and interfaces, not just an API backend

[14/05/2025, 18:10:50] Andie: Yeah thats why with these things we always need a full picture cause its so easy to miss all these tooling isnt it
[14/05/2025, 18:11:16] Andie: But this sounds really promising and could very much be place into Jira to also evaluate how we can proceed

[15/05/2025, 17:10:30] Andie: This is big and it makes it even more of a point to keep this very clear on the roadmap but ofcourse adoption has to mature a lot more cause unfortunately the cyber landscape with MCP is shaky

[15/05/2025, 19:50:56] Andie: Hey gents! been doing some deep divings, cause well that's my forte.
[15/05/2025, 19:51:40] Andie: what has surfaced even tho people have various motives for saying what they say on big platform, but I have also tested it and watched it for a while so I considerabily do believe to an extent:

Schmidt's mention of data generation and the limit of knowledge (inventing truly new things) relates to the idea that generic models might not be the ultimate answer for specialized tasks. Fine-tuning or training a proprietary model (as Joseph is considering) could allow GetAway to excel specifically at holiday planning reasoning and potentially reduce reliance on complex prompts, leading to better quality and potentially lower inference costs in the long run, creating intellectual property ("a moat") as discussed.
[15/05/2025, 19:51:58] Andie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id4YRO7G0wE
[15/05/2025, 19:54:24] Andie: former Google CEO, after all Google invented the Transformer Architecture and is amongst the fewest with the full stack. Custom chips - TPUs; ML SDKs; Free Jupyter Notebook resources for ML workloads experimentations; Google Cloud and credits for startups; Gemini open-source models that can be fine-tuned but do have a bit of a sketchy licence which is not easily told how permissible it is for commercialision and a bunch of vertical integrations that the other players lack cause they don't have technically such a finacial, institutional, historic leverage. ‎<This message was edited>
[15/05/2025, 19:54:57] Andie: some thoughts, love your feedbacks and being challenged so please do. just steering the conversation to finish up shaping the product roadmap, another forte of mine.

[15/05/2025, 20:03:48] Andie: Success will depend on making GetAway agent effectively use its tools to provide verifiable, high-quality, personalised results. Some KPIs to think about.

[16/05/2025, 20:12:06] Fizzy: Insightful
[16/05/2025, 20:19:52] Fizzy: I’ve always thought this. Just as we have people who are generalist and others who are specialist e.g A GP vs an Ophthalmologist, I think smaller specialist models will perform better than larger more generalist models in certain tasks. Also, from a moat standpoint, like I have always said, the value is in the wrapper. What get us customers is not only the ease of planning, but also taste. We need to focus incessantly on those two things
[16/05/2025, 20:23:22] Andie: and Google has created their most powerful model yet and just proved it, and we have officially entered into the Generative AI Agentic Agent Era self-improving moment of the AI industry equivalent to "Alphago move 37" more about it here:

[17/05/2025, 13:33:21] Andie: Firecrawl is excellent for extracting data from web pages, especially if those pages don't have a formal API. This is invaluable for getting information like: https://www.firecrawl.dev/

Details about activities from local event sites.

Information from smaller or niche hotel/rental websites.

Content from travel blogs or review sites for sentiment analysis.

Specific details from airline sites that aren't available via standard flight search APIs.
[17/05/2025, 13:33:27] Andie: With Firecrawl, your agent won't be limited to just the information available through formal, structured APIs. It can potentially pull data from a much wider universe of travel-related websites.
[17/05/2025, 13:33:35] Andie: You can use Firecrawl to make your activity suggestions richer, pull unique details about accommodations, or gather data for more nuanced recommendations.
[17/05/2025, 13:34:00] Andie: How you intelligently use Firecrawl to extract, structure, and synthesize data from web pages that your competitors aren't accessing via standard APIs becomes a part of your unique advantage (your "moat"). This requires building the adapter correctly and designing the AI's logic to know when and how to deploy this scraping tool effectively within the planning process.
[17/05/2025, 13:34:38] Andie: Using Firecrawl gives you a real-world use case to build one of those crucial adapter modules we discussed. You can design a standard "ScrapeWebContent" tool interface, write an adapter that calls the Firecrawl API, and integrate it into your ToolRegistry. This helps solidify the robust, modular architecture @⁨Fizzy⁩ Sir you're working on.
[17/05/2025, 13:34:58] Andie: The real win comes from effectively integrating this tool into the comprehensive, structured AI agent system
[17/05/2025, 13:46:11] Fizzy: Thanks, I’ll look into it. It’ll be good to have Airbnb accoms. on Getaway, but they don’t have an external API
[17/05/2025, 13:47:07] Andie: Comes in Firecrawl and the many credits this offer gives us for a good working product. They are new in the game but soon might find opensource alternative that dont use API like them as muchz
[17/05/2025, 13:47:25] Andie: Powerful moat still👌most importantly, going into a deck. ‎<This message was edited>
[17/05/2025, 15:05:02] Andie: Faster agent debugging: https://www.lmnr.ai/
[17/05/2025, 15:09:21] Andie: @⁨Fizzy⁩ Your AI agent is a complex system that takes a user request, plans steps, calls tools (your adapters to travel APIs), gets results, processes them, and generates a response. When things go wrong (like the caching issue you hit, or if the AI outputs a bad tool call, or if an API returns an error), it's hard to see exactly what happened step-by-step.

Laminar's tracing feature gives you visibility into this entire workflow. You can see the sequence of model calls, tool executions, and data flowing through your system in real-time. This is crucial for debugging why the agent failed, why it chose a particular path, or why the output isn't what you expected. The claim is it helps "fix issues 10x faster."
[17/05/2025, 15:10:01] Andie: Also Fizzy, you need to know if your agent is actually getting better at planning trips or if changes to prompts/code improve the quality of recommendations.

Laminar's evals allow you to define criteria and systematically test your agent's outputs against datasets. This helps you measure accuracy, relevance, and adherence to constraints. The text mentions it helps "maintain high accuracy while moving fast."
[17/05/2025, 15:11:34] Andie: Then, by seeing how the AI behaves in real-time traces and evaluating its outputs, you gain insights into how to refine your system prompts, tool descriptions, and parameters to make the LLM act as a more effective and reliable planner.

Features like LLM playground integration (using spans), Datasets built from span data, and Labels for spans directly support this iterative process of prompt refinement and understanding which model/prompt combination works best for specific tasks within your agent's workflow.
[17/05/2025, 15:12:17] Andie: The trace data collected by Laminar can be used to build datasets.

These datasets are valuable not only for evaluation but potentially for fine-tuning a model in the future (as discussed with @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ ), aiming for a proprietary model optimised for travel planning.
[17/05/2025, 15:12:43] Andie: Laminar offers Python SDKs and claims automatic tracing for popular LLM frameworks and models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc., many of which you are considering or using). Suggesting then that it can be integrated relatively easily into your existing Python/LLM codebase.
[17/05/2025, 15:13:01] Andie: This is critical infrastructure for building a reliable AI Agentic-first product.

[17/05/2025, 15:48:30] Andie: Pica is not a replacement for your core travel search integrations, unless they have unlisted connectors that are highly relevant. Instead, it's a potential tool to complement your core adapters.
[17/05/2025, 15:48:57] Andie: This saves you from building those specific, non-core adapters yourself.
[17/05/2025, 15:49:19] Andie: Reinforces Your Moat Strategy: Because Pica doesn't seem to cover the core travel booking APIs (based on this list), your strategy of building high-quality, in-house adapters for those critical travel data sources remains essential and is precisely where you build your unique domain expertise and moat. Pica's list shows that readily available, pre-built connectors for your specific core domain are not easily sourced, forcing you to build them, which is a good thing for your competitive position.
[17/05/2025, 15:49:48] Andie: the underlying framework is open source.
[17/05/2025, 15:50:30] Andie: The sheer number of different services Pica has built connectors for is the primary strength. It covers a huge range of common business software, productivity tools, social media, data services, etc. This demonstrates a powerful underlying framework and a significant investment in building these integrations.
[17/05/2025, 15:54:18] Andie: https://github.com/picahq The core value proposition – enabling an LLM agent to interact with 100+ APIs through a single SDK (pica.oneTool) – is a major step forward in agentic capabilities. It abstracts away the complexity of learning thousands of different API docs.

Each connector lists the number of "actions" (e.g., ActiveCampaign has 47 actions). This implies Pica has mapped specific API endpoints or functionalities into discrete, agent-callable actions with defined inputs and outputs.

The "Verified" and "Beta" tags provide some indication of maturity and reliability for each connector.

Authentication Handled (AuthKit): Pica explicitly offers AuthKit to manage authentication across these services, a notorious headache when integrating many APIs.
[17/05/2025, 16:10:39] Andie: Btw Your IP is multi-faceted, residing in your operational service, your data insights, your user experience, and your domain-specific AI logic. Building your travel adapters on a GPL framework like Pica is a strategic choice that leverages open source while requiring you to find value in aspects other than just the secrecy of the adapter code itself if you plan external monetisation. For your core GetAway product, it's primarily about using the framework to build essential infrastructure, which is a clear win.
[17/05/2025, 16:14:04] Andie: The Pica framework remains Pica's open-source project under the GPL. You are building on it, not claiming ownership of it.

You Cannot Keep the Source Code of Your Modifications/Connectors Built on GPL Secret if Distributed/Offered as a Service: although this holds true, and it's the core "copyleft" aspect of GPL. If you build your travel adapters using the Pica framework and then offer access to them via a network service, you'll likely have to share the source code of those adapters with the users of that service.
[17/05/2025, 16:19:25] Andie: Ultimately you get:

"GetAway Travel Agent Gateway" as a good descriptive name for the software product you are building.

Why "Gateway"? Because it acts as a single, standardised entry point to a multitude of diverse underlying external travel APIs, shielding the AI agent from their individual complexities.

Why "Agent"? Because its primary consumer is your AI agent.

Why "Travel"? Because it's specialised for the travel domain, containing your unique adapters and domain expertise.

1. Curated API Integrations: You've selected and integrated the specific travel APIs necessary for planning (flights, major hotels, niche 
accommodations, activities, etc.). This isn't just integrating any API; it's integrating the right ones for travel.

2. Domain-Specific Data Modeling: Your standard input and output schemas (e.g., FlightSearchParams, HotelResult, GroupPreferenceSchema) are designed to represent travel concepts accurately. You've figured out how to capture details like layover times, baggage allowances, specific hotel amenities, group member preferences, etc.

3. Translation of Travel Concepts: Your adapters and the logic within the Gateway understand how abstract user requests ("romantic," "family-friendly," "walkable neighborhood") translate into concrete travel API parameters or post-search filtering/analysis logic.

4. Handling Travel API Nuances: You've dealt with the specific complexities of travel APIs: variable pricing, real-time availability checks, complex search parameters, different booking flows, various error codes, and the often inconsistent ways different travel data sources present information.

5. Encoding Domain Expertise: Your design embodies your team's growing expertise in travel planning. What information is most important to a traveler? How should results be filtered or ranked for a group? What common pitfalls should the agent avoid? This knowledge is built into the Gateway's logic and the adapters' data processing.

Why "GetAway"? Because it's built by and for GetAway.

It is specifically built and optimised to understand and interact with the unique and complex characteristics of the travel industry's digital landscape.
[17/05/2025, 16:22:04] Andie: *Primary Internal Monetisation (Most Direct & Significant):*

*Enables the GetAway App (Indirect):* The Gateway's ability to reliably access and process travel data is essential for your GetAway AI agent to function. Without it, the agent cannot plan trips. You monetise the Gateway indirectly by charging users for the GetAway app's capabilities (subscription, per-booking fee, premium features enabled by the agent). This is the most direct and significant monetization path.

*Improves Agent Quality (Indirect):* A highly specialised Gateway provides better, more accurate, and more relevant data to the AI agent (higher "Constraint Clarity"). This leads to a higher-quality user experience, better reviews, increased user retention, and stronger word-of-mouth marketing (as discussed about GetAway's potential network effect), all of which drive monetisation.
[17/05/2025, 16:23:32] Andie: **Data/Insights Licensing* (if you collect and process data): If your Gateway processes enough data, you might derive insights (e.g., travel trends, booking patterns, popular amenities). While raw user data is private, aggregated, anonymised insights could potentially be valuable. (This is distinct from the Gateway itself, but enabled by its operation). ‎<This message was edited>
[17/05/2025, 16:24:16] Andie: *White-Label Service:* Offer the entire GetAway AI agent functionality (powered by the Gateway) as a white-label service to other travel companies. They could integrate it into their own apps/websites under their brand. The Gateway is a key piece of infrastructure supporting this.

[19/05/2025, 18:36:11] Fizzy: I have fixed three of the bugs that were on the Jira board. Here is the PR: https://github.com/fizzy-fifs/Getaway-AI-Assistant/pull/1. Thankfully, we only needed one PR for all three. @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ Please review and let me know what you think.
[19/05/2025, 20:30:08] Jo (Naija - BLW): Yep that works
[19/05/2025, 21:59:44] Fizzy: No Problem. I have sent the invite for tomorrow.
[19/05/2025, 22:00:24] Fizzy: Please can you make sure you review this PR ahead of the meeting? LMK if there are any issues
[19/05/2025, 22:00:42] Fizzy: See you guys tomorrow✌🏾
[20/05/2025, 16:44:06] Fizzy: Hi guys👋🏾. Are we all still good for 6:30?
[20/05/2025, 16:46:29] Andie: We are still good with me! Sure thing! I do need to come off at 7 exactly for another meeting I have in the US
[20/05/2025, 16:47:15] Fizzy: Okay, no worries bro. The meeting is scheduled for 30 mins anyways, so we’ll have to keep to time
[20/05/2025, 16:47:27] Fizzy: Did you say you had something you wanted to present?
[20/05/2025, 16:48:49] Andie: I did but Ill hold back cause with all the research I did I ve had to go back to the drawing table and dont want to be giving fragmented things. I need more like 45min
[20/05/2025, 16:51:57] Fizzy: Oh okay. Was this going to be on the UI redesign?
[20/05/2025, 16:59:36] Andie: Yes please, and also the rationale behind certain flows and how they reconcile with the data flow/models
[20/05/2025, 18:30:44] Andie: About to join! Please bear with
[20/05/2025, 18:34:13] Fizzy: No worries. I’ll be waiting in the room
[20/05/2025, 18:34:23] Fizzy: How about you @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ ?
[20/05/2025, 20:32:58] Andie: Sorey for dropping off the call like that guys
[20/05/2025, 23:27:10] Fizzy: That’s okay bro
[20/05/2025, 23:27:23] Fizzy: When would you like to do the presentation?
[21/05/2025, 09:00:52] Andie: Be probably ready to present next sprint? But will update certain things in between
[21/05/2025, 09:01:40] Andie: So by end of this sprint which is 2nd Jun isnt?
‎[21/05/2025, 11:59:01] Andie: ‎image omitted

[21/05/2025, 12:03:46] Andie: like I told you yesterday very very briefly @⁨Fizzy⁩ lmk could be a real game changer for @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ coding with you, and myself having product roadmap and design overview of what's coming and working well etc.
[21/05/2025, 12:49:17] Fizzy: Yeah, 2nd of June
[21/05/2025, 12:52:28] Andie: @⁨Fizzy⁩ another thing that would move us faster within the travel domain (like getting data from hard-to-scrape sites or handling specific booking processes) where using a pre-built "as a service" like Bright Data might be more efficient than building that specific capability yourself.

What Bright Data will do exactly for us at GetAway:

Bright Data is a web data platform that specialises in providing access to web data, especially when that data is hard to get using simple methods (due to blocking, CAPTCHAs, etc.).

For your GetAway AI agent project, Bright Data acts as a powerful data source tool, specifically enabling your agent to gather information from web pages that do not offer structured APIs for the data you need. It essentially provides "Web Data Access as a Service."
[21/05/2025, 12:52:31] Fizzy: Thank you. I’ll check it out now. I was just looking at the Github Coding Agent one. Looks good, you can just assign it an issue and move on to other things. Unfortunately it cost $39 per user per month😩.
[21/05/2025, 12:52:58] Andie: yeah typical enterprise fees, ludicrous.
[21/05/2025, 13:00:54] Andie: eventually we will be able to build one ourselves: 

LangGraph or AutoGen for Custom Agents

as we are technical and can roll our  own:

Use LangGraph, Autogen Studio, or CrewAI to build agents that can:

Read GitHub issues

Fetch relevant repo context

Draft a PR

Submit to GitHub via API

[22/05/2025, 14:45:20] Andie: Yeah it does take some careful selecting, cause is for the Pro, mine did but I also was questioning the same. I was planning to reach out to them cause 2 months is a solid offer before one even considers committing like that
[22/05/2025, 14:45:32] Andie: Just haven’t had the time yet.

[02/06/2025, 13:58:12] Andie: 🙋‍♂️
[02/06/2025, 14:22:20] Fizzy: Yes. Hope we’re all still good for 6pm
[02/06/2025, 14:22:42] Fizzy: @⁨Andie⁩ you’re going to be doing a presentation, right?
[02/06/2025, 14:22:43] Andie: I think 6:30 will be safest for me be honest with u otherwise it gets a bit rushed
[02/06/2025, 14:22:45] Andie: Joining in
[02/06/2025, 14:22:49] Andie: Yes please
[02/06/2025, 14:23:00] Andie: Finishing up putting together the prezzy
[02/06/2025, 14:23:02] Andie: For it
[02/06/2025, 14:23:09] Fizzy: Oh yeah. We did say 6:30, didn’t we?
[02/06/2025, 14:23:19] Andie: If that still works for @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ too
[02/06/2025, 14:23:23] Andie: Thanks be great
[02/06/2025, 14:23:39] Andie: Otherwise can always find mutually convenient arrangements etc
[02/06/2025, 14:24:20] Andie: @⁨Fizzy⁩ hope u had the time to review all your Moat and IPs too over the pasts weeks and whatnot?
[02/06/2025, 14:24:25] Andie: If not thats fine just checking
[02/06/2025, 15:29:46] Jo (Naija - BLW): Can we meet separately @⁨Fizzy⁩ or maybe Tuesday? Just returning from annual leave and got so much to catch up on
[02/06/2025, 15:42:08] Andie: Woudl be good if u were there too
[02/06/2025, 15:42:14] Andie: Dont mind shifting it to tomorrow?
[02/06/2025, 15:42:28] Andie: Or wheatever best suits us all within this week plz
[02/06/2025, 15:42:38] Andie: We dont meet as often so would be good re-group
[02/06/2025, 16:40:23] Fizzy: I haven’t finished going through all of them yet. It was quite a lot lol, but I should be done with it by the end of this sprint
[02/06/2025, 16:42:49] Fizzy: Yeah, that’s cool, we can catch up separately, but it would still be good for us to meet today, even if you don’t have much of an update. I too was t able to do much this sprint as I had a few things that took up my attention. Can you still make 6:30?Should we move it to later today?
[02/06/2025, 16:44:47] Fizzy: Yeah, agreed. I was thinking, we should start doing daily updates. It’ll help us stay accountable and move quicker. It’d be on here, so we don’t have to jump on a call all the time, but every morning, we can put on here one or two sentences about what we did the previous day, what we’ll be doing today, and blockers if any.
[02/06/2025, 16:47:20] Fizzy: Also, if you guys want, we can schedule some time for us to meet up virtually and do some work. We’ll just be on a call in silence working on our tickets. I know we all have our 9-5s and other things that might be taking up our time, so it’ll be good to actually set some time aside to work on Getaway. Otherwise, the week just goes by and we won’t have spent enough time on Getaway. What do you guys think?@⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ @⁨Andie⁩
[02/06/2025, 17:01:30] Jo (Naija - BLW): 7??
[02/06/2025, 17:02:17] Fizzy: @⁨Andie⁩ can you do 7?

[03/06/2025, 19:48:34] Meta AI: Getaway is a group trip planning app developed by Afifoluwa Akinyemi, also known as Fifolu Akinyemi. The app aims to simplify the process of planning a trip with friends by providing features such as ¹ ²:
- *Group Creation and Management*: Create a group for your upcoming trip and invite friends to join. All trip-related discussions and information are stored in one place.
- *Trip Planning Made Easy*: Plan multiple trips within a group without the hassle. Enter your destination, choose dates, and set budget limits.
- *Individual Preferences and Budgets*: Each group member can input their available dates and budget range for the trip. Getaway's smart algorithm will take care of the rest.
- *Smart Recommendations*: Getaway combines everyone's preferences and provides three personalized trip options that suit everyone.
- *In-App Chat*: Stay connected with your travel buddies through the app's chat feature, making coordination a breeze.

The app is available on Google Play with over 10 downloads and is rated for users aged 10 and above. According to the app's description, Getaway ensures ¹ ²:
- *Efficient Planning*: Streamlines the planning process, allowing you to focus on the fun parts of the trip.
- *Personalization*: The app's smart algorithm ensures that each trip suggestion caters to individual preferences and constraints.
- *Transparency*: All group members can view available options and participate in the decision-making process.

You can find more information about Getaway and its features on Google Play. There's also another app called Getaway Local that offers taxi booking services, but it's a different app from the one developed by Fifolu Akinyemi ³. ‎<This message was edited>

[03/06/2025, 20:44:20] Andie: so this pratically becomes the "Explorer Page" of travelling which is supposed to create over time a "For You" page to the users to not only feel like planning with the App but also feel inspired by our globe. That is AI driven.
[03/06/2025, 20:52:09] Andie: The "sphere" in this application refers to a 3D spherical layout where the photos are visualised. You can see this in action when the "sphere" button is active in the controls at the bottom. It arranges the photo nodes in a 3D sphere that you can rotate and explore.

The "Gemini chat" (or more accurately, the Gemini integration) powers the natural language search functionality. When you type a query into the search bar (e.g., "show me pictures of winter" or "mathematical concepts"), that query is sent to a Gemini model. 

The model processes your request, understands the intent, and then identifies the most relevant images from the collection based on their descriptions. 

It also generates a short, conversational commentary about the found images, which you see displayed above the search bar.
[04/06/2025, 14:19:48] Fizzy: Hi guys, here’s my update:
I wasn’t able to work on Getaway yesterday. 
Today, I am going to:
	Purchase a domain name
	Create email address for the three of us
	Schedule the rooms we agreed on last night
	Continue dev work on checkpointing
[04/06/2025, 14:20:54] Fizzy: @⁨Andie⁩ Can you send me the link for the Google workspace credits you mentioned yesterday. I am going to get that set up and create the rooms for collaboration
[04/06/2025, 14:26:35] Andie: Hello lads! @⁨Fizzy⁩ for greater context: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ9ZVPITle3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

[04/06/2025, 14:29:38] Andie: Meanwhile I have been taking onboard your feedback and narrowed my focus from bigger picture to minute detailed user workflows and currently browsing true library of components, one of such today was this: https://21st.dev/home

[04/06/2025, 14:34:04] Andie: At this point everyone in some shape or form has interfaced with a TomTom once and now everyday Waze and Google Maps. 

This principle of design is inspired by my Uni days studying Geographical Information System (GIS) and learning how to layer data and using APIs to populate maps progressively like Google ultimately come through and killed it with Google Earth and Maps/Sreet View.
[04/06/2025, 14:35:19] Andie: There’s something there that can be orchestrated and emerge in terms of optimal immersive planning experience which with the visual and explorer effect alone captures the user innate sense of “Gettingaway”
[04/06/2025, 14:35:23] Andie: You get?
[04/06/2025, 14:35:39] Andie: So mostly for me has been your feedbacks.
[04/06/2025, 14:38:08] Andie: Then wanted to share a quick but very solid prompt engineer inspiring video for your current agents development efforts, I have a lot of ideas around that but I know you have been munching on it for months now @⁨Fizzy⁩ , so pls definitely let me know and you @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ be good we are explore similar ideas spaces and expanding each others: https://youtu.be/uDIW34h8cmM?si=IyXokQqaesfpQgL9
[04/06/2025, 14:42:27] Andie: This covers well what Ive been talking about, good for us all to appreciate better: https://youtu.be/iKAlo_fW0w0?si=shcq5lAt_3g2cvYo
[04/06/2025, 14:43:22] Andie: I know my ideas may seem very fragmented and I promise this will all make more sense very soon. Let’s just trust the process but looking forward to connect front end to back end successfully, merges are the most painful part of the journey 🥲
[04/06/2025, 15:12:11] Fizzy: Thank you for the resources @⁨Andie⁩. I'll have a look at each one of them.
[04/06/2025, 15:15:09] Fizzy: I was thinking about this. I don’t mind the maps overlay, but I was thinking perhaps it might be a bit much for some users especially if you’re using the app for the first time. I think we should have this as a toggle option rather than the default layout. In other words, users can choose if they want to see the hotels and attractions overlayed on the map. Just so they don’t feel too crowded or overwhelmed. What do you think?
[04/06/2025, 15:16:03] Andie: Absolutely precisely like how Google with their Maps products changes the map topology according to what you car about seeing.
[04/06/2025, 15:24:08] Andie: Agreed, I was thinking along similar lines, especially considering what @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ mentioned last night about feeling overwhelmed by too many options in Notion. 

In fact Notion, as a SaaS platform, offers an extremely feature-rich interface with lots of menus, toggles, templates, and customisation options visible upfront, which can easily cause cognitive overload for first-time users who are still trying to understand the core functionality and navigation.

This ties directly into a well-studied area of human cognition: our working memory has a limited capacity and can only attend to a certain amount of information at once.
[04/06/2025, 15:24:42] Andie: *NOTE TO SELF*
That’s why visual hierarchy is so paramount; not just in web copy with H1, H2, H3, paragraphs, and titles, but also in interface design. Proper hierarchy helps users focus by organising information in a clear, digestible way.

Making the map overlays optional via a toggle respects these cognitive limits, reducing initial complexity and avoiding sensory overload for first-time users. It also empowers users with control, allowing them to choose when and how much information they want to see, which enhances usability and improves the onboarding experience.
[04/06/2025, 16:25:48] Fizzy: Guys, I have set up a collab room. It will be open from 4:30pm till midnight. Feel free to pop in and do some work. You should all have received an invite
[04/06/2025, 17:01:13] Andie: Thank you Fizzy🙏
[04/06/2025, 18:53:33] Andie: just sharing the last thing I was working on before presenting you my ideas yesterday as it was still buggy but I finally fix the splashscreen yesterday you watch a certain protoype of it alongside with the app interfaces and workflows but this is now v1/2 to what will eventually become the motion graphic with sound coming soon that will walkthough a serious of screen onboarding users. Its all also going to be displayed depending on where in your user journey you are: just downloaded the app, just installed via web etc etc.

[04/06/2025, 18:59:05] Andie: if you ever other any other new copy for the agentic capabilities that's coming into it let me know @⁨Fizzy⁩ as at the moment I thought of these play on word: Getaway - The neW WAY of Travelling Planning / The neW WAY of Travelling and Planning / Travelling & Planning
[04/06/2025, 19:01:47] Andie: won't be able to join in the room today but will be from tomorrow for the rest of the week.
[04/06/2025, 19:29:48] Andie: *Brand storytelling* through visual metaphor (big bang kina *chaos* signifies new genesis then → *order* which is the calm after the storm in our case → here comes *travel* *planning* the Getaway's way)

Novelty effect creates memorable first impression

Progressive disclosure builds anticipation without overwhelming

Particle aesthetics reflect travel industry dynamism

Canvas-based rendering for smooth 60fps animation

*Mouse/Touch Responsiveness*: Users can scatter particles creating immediate feedback

*Reformation Behavior*: Particles return to airplane shape demonstrating brand resilience

*Temporal Sequence Design*

📱 *User Journey Mapping*:

0-3000ms: Particle chaos → airplane formation (creates curiosity and visual engagement)

3500ms: "GETAWAY" emergence with glow effect (brand name recognition)

4300ms: Tagline revelation (value proposition communication)

5300ms+: Stable state with interactive particles (user engagement opportunity)

6000-8000ms: Transition trigger to main application interface ‎<This message was edited>

[05/06/2025, 09:15:19] Andie: Morning! not sure of today's room timings but this is also the prototype final look and workflow which just generally organises the things we have been discussing, it's still in evolution, we'll get there:https://getaway-ai-voyage-planner.lovable.app/

pretty much a high-fidelity wireframe/mock-up at this stage. ‎<This message was edited>
[05/06/2025, 12:15:39] Fizzy: Thanks. This looks good so far. Not sure about the intro bit though. Is that going to be in the final UI design?
[05/06/2025, 12:22:07] Fizzy: My daily update:

Yesterday, I purchased the domain name getawayai.app, as well as the google workspace subscription that allows us to have 24hrs on google meet. If you have a look at the domain now, it has a “coming soon” page on there from godaddy. 

I also continued dev work on the short term memory story. 

Today, I’ll be doing more of the same. Working on the story. I’ll let you guys know if I have any other updates
[05/06/2025, 12:24:14] Fizzy: I’ll create today’s collab room now and leave it open till midnight. Going forward, I’m going to schedule the rooms to be open from 5am till midnight. We can just drop a message on here when we’re about to step into the room
[05/06/2025, 15:10:41] Andie: thanky ou @⁨Fizzy⁩
[05/06/2025, 15:11:25] Andie: no it won't, take it as a temporal placeholder to iterate more on final ideations and ultimate implementation of the design system that I'll be finalising
[05/06/2025, 18:21:05] Andie: thanks for this daily update @⁨Fizzy⁩ and well done for such a cool domain name. I am going to be trailing joining for the sake of testing today, but it a lot more likely i will do tomorrow for like 2hr after work times. I hope things paned out for you today?
[05/06/2025, 18:21:23] Andie: sounds like a solid plan, I like that!
[06/06/2025, 13:09:46] Andie: Afternoon gents!
I haven’t had much success catching up on the work I was doing yesterday.
As disappointing as that may be,
I’ll likely be able to jump in for an hour or so after work today.
I’ll be in the room and aim to round up a few things for the week.
I appreciate that we’re trying to move at a certain pace.
I’m doing my best to stay as communicative as I can on my end.
How’s things looking for you, @⁨Fizzy⁩ ? and @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/2025, 13:12:54] Andie: Gentle reminder to take some time to review the most relevant documents,
mostly sent over via email. @⁨Fizzy⁩ 

This will help us wrap up the conversation around Moat.
But above all, it’s about IP protection and having a proper NDA in place.

A good example of how the NDA process can be streamlined:
I have a bunch of vetted examples from actual client work and brand partnerships I've overseen.
These can help us generate accurate NDAs quickly.

Let me know your thoughts on this brief docoumentation work that absolutlely needs doing and the workflows opportunity it presents. 

As this links wel to what I am talking about in terms of NDA automation and compliance and contracts among ourselves, its the number one mistake people make and the easiest to avoid too, if we are to keep each other this accountable, I just like things done proper so I know I am not stepping on any toes even by accident/negligence:

[07/06/2025, 13:00:30] Fizzy: Hi guys,
[07/06/2025, 13:01:04] Fizzy: Sorry, yesterday I had my attention on other matters that’s why I was unresponsive
[07/06/2025, 13:02:56] Fizzy: I didn’t get time to work on Getaway yesterday, so unfortunately, I don’t have any updates
[07/06/2025, 13:03:30] Fizzy: I am in the collab room now and I’ll be there for another few hours please feel free to join.
‎[07/06/2025, 13:06:44] Fizzy: ‎image omitted
[07/06/2025, 13:07:33] Fizzy: Thank you Andie. I’ll spend some more time reviewing it this coming week and I should be all caught up by the next sprint planning
[07/06/2025, 13:07:49] Jo (Naija - BLW): This would be fantastic. Good thinking
[07/06/2025, 13:08:55] Fizzy: That’s okay Andie. Would you be able to do some work on it today? How about you @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩?
[07/06/2025, 13:09:34] Jo (Naija - BLW): Yes, I will be working in it today
‎[07/06/2025, 13:49:24] Andie: ‎image omitted
[07/06/2025, 13:49:39] Andie: https://www.pegasusangelaccelerator.com/accelerate
[07/06/2025, 13:51:34] Andie: Its all good, hasnt been as smooth for me either.
[07/06/2025, 13:52:12] Andie: Alright gonna see if I can join briefly just to sync up.
[07/06/2025, 13:52:25] Fizzy: You know what, this whole I’ve been thinking: launch a product first, then apply to accelerators/raise a seed round. But there’s no reason why we can’t apply to accelerators as a pre product company and raise a pre seed.
[07/06/2025, 13:52:48] Fizzy: Will you guys quit your jobs if we get into an accelerator?👀
[07/06/2025, 13:53:05] Andie: Won’t be able to do much cause Im finishing up working, had a shift today and then need to get ready to head out for my sister’s 30th bday meal
[07/06/2025, 13:57:08] Andie: 🙆‍♂️ I think thats been whats been on my mind for a while now. I am quite 50/50 cause I have quite a major stake in the current Product Manager role I am in. 

But would definitely love to discuss more of a fractional term.  Ad-hoc contributions to move the needle where I can the most.

I do genuinely love the whole agentic travelling planning experience and almost “multiplayer” experience and definitely don’t wanna be halfhearted in it. 

But i think I just have to be honest about my capacity. I have told myself to keep options open tho. 

I’m coming to the end of my probation with the Product role in July. So just being careful on not burning bridges cause it’s been already quite a journey with them and good for me to pick up more product strategy skills and snr mentors shaping me up. ‎<This message was edited>
[07/06/2025, 13:59:03] Andie: You are indeed correct that it really does not take having the entire product built out and what have you but I was also carefully reading into the terms and almost holding back to sending yet cause I wanted to understand the equity better so invite you to maybe have a extensive read or analysis with AI over it and let’s see if you strongly still feel the same way, just some thoughts
[07/06/2025, 14:01:36] Andie: Joining the room shortly now
[07/06/2025, 14:03:03] Andie: No worries, I’ll keep things more on hold and batch them, been thinking of doing so to have better track and overview of thought provoking pieces like this that aren’t just selling dreams.
[07/06/2025, 16:07:04] Andie: Couldn’t join in today, will catch up on another day. I’ve had few things come up.
[09/06/2025, 15:00:08] Fizzy: Hi guys, I am in the collab room and I’ll be here till 8/9pm. Would be nice for us to sit together and do some work for a couple of hours today.
[09/06/2025, 17:55:30] Andie: Hi @⁨Fizzy⁩ just finishing off work now, sorry been quite busy today, caught sight of the message but was to split across stuff. It'd be indeed nice for us to sit together, any chance we could do more of that tomorrow. Evening is manageable but I usually try to keep it to close to my end of work hrs. So any where from 4:30 till 6pm.0 ‎<This message was edited>
[09/06/2025, 18:19:53] Fizzy: Yeah we should do that. I’m good for 4:30. Also, we could add early mornings if you want?
[10/06/2025, 09:36:54] Andie: Yeah that’s cool with me Fizzy, sorry for the late response.
[10/06/2025, 09:38:10] Andie: I think with early mornings I may be occasionally able to do them, but typically they are reserved to taking care of my mother cause she did suffer with a heart attack last year and can’t do as much lately, so Ive had to step in a lot
[10/06/2025, 09:39:00] Andie: But let’s how does go, I’ll never the less make the time whenever possible to participate in such workflows as well
[10/06/2025, 09:40:53] Fizzy: OMG! I’m am so sorry to hear this. How is she doing now?
[10/06/2025, 09:42:25] Andie: No no pls she is way better now, it happened last year mid summer, and so she hadn’t been able to work anymore since then. She holding up well now but lost much of her mobility and I am trying the best way I can to get her to regain muscle mass and be more agile again and get around the house
[10/06/2025, 09:42:45] Andie: I genuinely thought I communicated this before, sorry to making you find out like this
[10/06/2025, 09:43:20] Andie: Didnt mean to give you a scare, we managing just fine, there’s great days and there’s bad ones
[10/06/2025, 10:59:06] Fizzy: Glad to hear🙏🏾
[10/06/2025, 17:12:16] Jo (Naija - BLW): My God! So sorry to hear! May God grant her healing
[10/06/2025, 17:15:59] Andie: Thank you man🙏
[11/06/2025, 18:10:05] Andie: Hello gents! Do you think we can manage a sync up this week?
[11/06/2025, 18:10:42] Andie: There’s a lot happening at the moment, and the product direction and documentation on Jira should at least be continued and mapped out; that way, we can simply shuffle and reshuffle things as needed. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/06/2025, 18:11:10] Andie: I am focusing on detailing these things so that there’s no opportunity for burnout, especially in the absence of a clear roadmap. 

At the moment, a lot of it is still in our individual heads. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/06/2025, 18:12:20] Andie: That’s why I was hoping for a full review of the ideas outlined and the documents I sent over to you before diving even deeper into development. 

I think as hands-on technical people, it’s very normal for us to try to kill multiple birds with one stone; but strategy and scalability discussions need to be part of the process from the very beginning. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/06/2025, 18:13:40] Andie: Apple has made a power move that everyone seems to be sleeping on; but I’ve picked up on it, and I won’t lie to you, it’s making me seriously rethink a lot of our UI and UX decisions. 

We are most definitely in a position to make bold bets on the future of human-centered design and the visual-spatial principles I was discussing with you all. ‎<This message was edited>

[16/06/2025, 19:45:28] Andie: Just that has these ideas come I like to shelf them
[17/06/2025, 11:52:16] Fizzy: Morning guys. I am in the collab room and I’ll be there till much later in the day. Would be nice to actually collaborate today.
[17/06/2025, 16:55:23] Andie: Sorry was in crisis management today, might be a better day tomorrow to catch up on stuff and focused sesh
[17/06/2025, 19:33:58] Andie: Hey team! 👋 Had a breakthrough on the data front that directly addresses our discussions on accuracy and speeding up final decisions for Getaway.

You know how Fizzy's been emphasizing the need for rock-solid, specific, and reliable data for flight and hotel bookings? Especially the exact prices, real-time availability, and a super smooth booking process? ‎<This message was edited>
[17/06/2025, 19:34:32] Andie: Enters: Duffel https://duffel.com/blog/data-driven-travel-using-analytics-from-the-duffel-api-to-make-smarter-business-decisions
[17/06/2025, 19:35:14] Andie: I've been looking deeper into Duffel API and it's a perfect fit! 🎯 just cause I run into it cleaning my emails today, so very serendipitous ‎<This message was edited>
[17/06/2025, 19:36:22] Andie: *Precision & Reliability*: Duffel is built specifically for "*Accessing Airline Booking Capabilities to Sell Tickets*" and provides "data from flight & hotel bookings and searches". It delivers that "structured, precise, real-time data directly from the source of truth" – exactly what we need for critical pricing and availability. This directly counters the potential "messy" and "brittle" aspects of web parsing for core transactional data.
[17/06/2025, 19:36:28] Andie: @⁨Fizzy⁩
[17/06/2025, 19:36:54] Andie: *Seamless Booking Integration*: Duffel's API simplifies getting users directly to the booking step with pre-filled parameters, supporting that smooth journey which is crucial for conversion and our affiliate model.
[17/06/2025, 19:37:22] Andie: *Dynamic Pricing Models:* It enables businesses to "*implement dynamic pricing models that adapt to market trends*", ensuring our suggestions are always competitive and help maximize revenue.
[17/06/2025, 19:39:53] Jo (Naija - BLW): Yh Duffel is on our list of APIs to test out
[17/06/2025, 19:40:05] Jo (Naija - BLW): Have you tested it out already?
[17/06/2025, 19:40:31] Andie: Well then here is your sign! I havent but i check it against our MVP goals and roadmap and it fits like a glove.
[17/06/2025, 19:40:48] Andie: Cause its B2B so they will have only great interest to work with a product like ours
[17/06/2025, 19:41:38] Jo (Naija - BLW): Music to my ears! Will make that priority to test out
[17/06/2025, 19:47:30] Andie: Yeah cause also for its addon perks we can strike a deal with the B2B they are: 

In essence, Duffel provides the broad, market-level intelligence on what types of ancillary services are popular for specific destinations and traveler profiles, derived from extensive booking data. 

Getaway's AI agent then takes this intelligence and filters it through the lens of a specific group's established and inferred preferences (e.g., budget, interests, group size), using its conversational and data aggregation capabilities. 

This fusion allows Getaway to offer highly relevant and timely ancillary service suggestions, creating a more personalised experience for the users and unlocking significant revenue potential through affiliate partnerships ‎<This message was edited>

Where have you gotten up to? @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ I see you’ve added your findings to this story(https://getawayai.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-5). Do you want to go ahead and get started with creating the ticket master tool?
[10/07/2025, 13:40:44] Andie: Hi gents! Hope you’re both doing well.

Thanks, Fizzy! really appreciate your message and the updates. 

Definitely hear you on being MIA; sounds like things have been full-on with job hunting and tech tests, so big respect for staying on top of it all. Hats off.
[10/07/2025, 13:41:00] Andie: It’s been a packed period on my end too as we continue onboarding new clients and scaling Global Purpose Enterprise globally. 

That said, I’ve carved out some time to properly review everything; likely tomorrow after work.
[10/07/2025, 13:42:55] Andie: In the meantime, to keep things moving and avoid unnecessary UI/UX rework, I’ll shift focus towards finalising the GetAway app onboarding workflow, on which I had dropped the ball and also relating tickets. 

All the prior research has helped, so I’m aiming to clarify and perfect that now before diving deeper into further build basically, that’s me.
[10/07/2025, 14:29:43] Fizzy: Nice!! Thanks for the update. Looking forward to the final result, both for the onboarding workflow and the complete redesign
[10/07/2025, 14:30:18] Fizzy: I think we can probably release the new onboarding workflow straight away and not wait till the redesign is done
[10/07/2025, 14:40:53] Andie: sunds good to me Fizzy!! it's a shout.
[10/07/2025, 14:41:18] Fizzy: @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ do you have any updates?
[10/07/2025, 21:19:27] Jo (Naija - BLW): Sorry Not yet! Will send updates over the weekend
[14/07/2025, 12:49:39] Fizzy: Hi guys, how are we all doing? Hope we are all well?
[14/07/2025, 12:51:07] Fizzy: We have our sprint meeting today. We can’t afford to miss it like we did the last one. It’ll be a good time to touch base with each other  as realign ourselves with the work.
[14/07/2025, 12:51:17] Fizzy: Is 6:30 good for everyone?
[14/07/2025, 13:07:31] Andie: Hi @⁨Fizzy⁩ ! Happy for us to regroup later today. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to make much project from the last time we spoke due to some development blockers that I still need to document on Jira self. But it’d defo great to touch base and re-align exactly.
[14/07/2025, 13:27:38] Fizzy: Yeah, the point of the meeting is to talk about these blockers and ways we can assist each other to work better.
[14/07/2025, 13:28:17] Fizzy: How about you @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩? You’re good for 6:30, yeah?
[14/07/2025, 18:30:24] Fizzy: Hi guys, I am in the room waiting
[14/07/2025, 18:31:07] Andie: Joining now just my laptop playing up a bit
[14/07/2025, 18:31:30] Jo (Naija - BLW): Sorry still working
[14/07/2025, 18:32:20] Fizzy: What time are you available? Would be good to sync up with everyone
[14/07/2025, 20:13:14] Jo (Naija - BLW): Is 9 fine? Sorry just seen this
[14/07/2025, 22:45:14] Fizzy: Oh it’s fine. Andie and I already met. We can meet up tomorrow if you want.
[18/07/2025, 12:52:30] Andie: Yeah was good
[18/07/2025, 12:52:35] Andie: @⁨Fizzy⁩ https://youtube.com/shorts/kNgIVNa86hc?si=Rr5Tsp6JgYMQcKTb
[18/07/2025, 12:53:30] Andie: What do you think of this! I can already think of a few product UI/UX stuff obvs barebone that can make us superior given our agentic flows
[18/07/2025, 15:30:55] Andie: Also for you @⁨Fizzy⁩ 

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/searchguy_agenticai-designpatterns-ai-activity-7351622833136906241-GPiR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&rcm=ACoAAA7U4mUB5GTcCv-kFTil8-RJzIfbOAt8IU4

And potentially @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ 

Distinguished Engineer talk.
[18/07/2025, 17:52:44] Fizzy: Bookmarked. Thanks🙌🏾
[18/07/2025, 17:54:55] Fizzy: Yeah, I think this is a good way to sort of get info on user archetypes, but it’d only make sense if the questions being asked are relevant.
[19/07/2025, 09:52:30] Andie: Thanks for the feedback man
[19/07/2025, 09:52:45] Andie: I got another profound shift for you as well for the Memory part of Dora

[19/07/2025, 09:53:21] Andie: definitely worth taking into analysis consideration for our Product & Features roadmap 🗺️
[19/07/2025, 09:53:49] Andie: Hopefully we get there with everything soon 🤞 ! Been a lot of long days lately. The grind continues 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[19/07/2025, 09:55:28] Andie: You lot probably also know Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-gemma-3n-hackathon

So this is the competition I was tellin you have entered myself in solo and trying to Win, tough competition but I feel reasonably confident
[19/07/2025, 09:57:23] Andie: The greatest perk the Gemma nano models with multimodality by design and dual reasoning mode whathaveyou, has permissive license and can become your *proprietary technology* . A whole moat.
[21/07/2025, 17:44:28] Fizzy: Hey guys, I just had a conversation with a company called CloudPlexo. They help startups with their cloud costs. They can help us secure up to $5,000 in AWS credits and also help with cost optimisation. ‎<This message was edited>
[21/07/2025, 17:45:15] Fizzy: https://cloudplexo.com/
[21/07/2025, 17:46:06] Fizzy: They want us to have a technical session next, where they’ll go through our architecture and see what services we could move to AWS and where we could make savings
[21/07/2025, 17:46:07] Andie: Haleuja✨ wow! I was wondering what was AWS offering for cloud credits. Having studied and currently still studying their Solution Architect tho Id only say they have strong vendor lock in so hopefully we can do some serious cost monitoring and cloud optimisation to have crazy runaway cause its a workable strategy 👌
[21/07/2025, 17:46:17] Andie: Just replying on the fly cause im workin on GetAway atm
[21/07/2025, 17:46:36] Fizzy: No worries bro
[21/07/2025, 17:46:45] Andie: That would be very sound also good case stufy for my revision, taking the exam in a month or so
[21/07/2025, 17:47:10] Andie: Contrats on the deal, seems very promising!
[21/07/2025, 17:49:03] Fizzy: I’d like for at least one (preferably both) of you guys to be there
[21/07/2025, 17:49:40] Andie: Count me in, I’ll be there. Want to hear it end to end and see if it influences anything
[21/07/2025, 17:49:47] Fizzy: The meeting is at 3pm next Monday
[21/07/2025, 17:50:02] Andie: Good time as well, awesome👌
[21/07/2025, 17:50:30] Andie: Calendared.
[21/07/2025, 17:53:23] Fizzy: Thanks!
[21/07/2025, 17:54:06] Fizzy: @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ how about you? Would love for you to be there seeing as you’re also working on the agent
[21/07/2025, 23:45:29] Jo (Naija - BLW): Sure!  Can’t promise because 3pm on Monday is prime work time

[28/07/2025, 20:41:27] Andie: Gents! curated an email for you on a 1k plus curated .csv I pulled from my linkedin to condense all that has matured and has solid use case and direct connection to Dora and the overall GetAway market moat, when you have the time please, dig through it yourself.

I give an overview of each part, much to save the time from going down any rabbit holes, just surfacing the resilience of the technologies, mental models, patterns etc.

[28/07/2025, 21:07:07] Andie: The program knows  as the "Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub" is undergoing a major transformation. The name "Founders Hub" is being retired, and the program is splitting into two distinct, separate paths with vastly different levels of support. The core principle has shifted from a broad, open-door policy to a tiered system that heavily favors startups with existing institutional backing.

The Old Way (What I had Signed Up For): A single, accessible program (Founders Hub) open to nearly all early-stage founders, offering a generous package of Azure credits and, crucially, access to a suite of powerful tools like GitHub Enterprise and LinkedIn Premium. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/07/2025, 21:08:02] Andie: Apparently *The New Way (As of July 2nd):*

The Investor-Backed Path: An exclusive, high-touch program for startups that are referred by a VC, accelerator, university, or incubator within Microsoft's new "Investor Network." This is the premier tier.

The Azure Startup Credit Offer: A basic, self-service path open to any new startup.
‎[28/07/2025, 21:08:52] Andie: ‎image omitted
[28/07/2025, 21:10:47] Andie: Now this means my ability even in this cohourt  to get more funding from them is cut off unless I can secure a referral from an affiliated investor, which I am thinking for me might be: https://www.f6s.com/company-deals/microsoft/up-to-16-off-microsoft-365-16086
[28/07/2025, 21:12:43] Andie: Microsoft has just signaled that the most valuable support is now gated behind venture capitalists and accelerators. It's no longer enough to just have a good idea and apply.
[28/07/2025, 21:13:24] Andie: This moves does show that we must now actively prioritise getting into programs too or securing funding from investors who are part of these "*Investor* *Networks*." Our ability to fund our infrastructure is now directly tied to our ability to network and gain entry into these exclusive ecosystems. Similarly to today's

I am trying to finish off a few things today but I haven’t not been my most productive so I’ll be back in touch. Prolly beginning of the week. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/08/2025, 13:18:37] Andie: Not too bad
[11/08/2025, 13:18:43] Andie: Just managing setbacks
[11/08/2025, 13:18:51] Fizzy: Just wanted to remind everyone of our meeting later today at 6:30pm. Looking forward to syncing up with you guys!
[11/08/2025, 13:18:56] Andie: But we move🙏

[11/08/2025, 13:19:05] Fizzy: Oh what setbacks?
[11/08/2025, 13:20:20] Andie: Just trying to translate much of what we discussed in workable design. But will be easier to explain over voice.
[11/08/2025, 13:21:49] Fizzy: Okay, no worries. Looking forward to hearing it from you.

[12/08/2025, 11:20:21] Andie: this is literally what I have been trying to finish sketching out but ofcos with their virality they have primetime with the major platforms that want to partner with them.
[12/08/2025, 11:22:47] Andie: But watching this last night completely further confirmed that they are still missing a deep integration opportunity, just cannot tell how long till they truly catch on cause they are more concerned about becoming vertically competent across a few too many verticals, if that makes sense? look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-oq1EXSfZ0

powerful aggregation but still too much time spent without prompting straight forward choices for the users to save time and NOT become decision fatigued. My market research revealed on average in the UK a group can spend 8hrs of planning to coordinate a trip. A full day work shift.
[12/08/2025, 11:23:35] Andie: https://www.movee.ai/blog/perplexity-travel-the-future-of-ai-powered-trip-planning

just some brief good reads to catch up to the state of things.
[12/08/2025, 11:26:05] Andie: with users proliferating online untapped use case, which obvs give way to Perplexity to double down, https://evejweinberg.medium.com/the-best-untapped-use-case-for-perplexity-travel-d586ee121ef3

I strongly see us either going around it by creating just as good of an API that pulls authoritive sources like they do and they are masters at or we genuinely just use their api, but obfuscated what we are doing with it so that we can just match the accuracy but do not make the traffic clear to them of how exactly we are doing what we are doing to avoid them actually reverse engineering us, which unfortunately does happen. these lots are shady as hell.

[13/08/2025, 18:57:42] Andie: The program also provides up to £10,000 in additional funds for business support. This is separate from your salary and is used for business expenses like legal fees for incorporation, accounting software, or initial cloud hosting costs before other credits kick in.

[18/08/2025, 20:58:39] Fizzy: Hi guys👋🏾 here is the action plan from today’s conversation:

- [ ] Fifolu to look into incentive based equity sharing
- [ ] Fifolu to find out about Getaway AI sponsoring Joseph for Global Talent Visa
- [ ] Joseph to confirm if he can co-found a company on his current visa.
- [ ] Andie to check with his contact if you can start a company on a skilled worker visa

Let me know if I left anything out and I’d add it. Looking forward to seeing you guys on Friday at 12:00pm✌🏾.

https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/rovo-dev-command-line-interface
[29/08/2025, 11:18:32] Andie: basically and agent system that is the equivalent of a GitHub pr one but here for Jira and boards, to take care of documenting and ticketing etc.
[29/08/2025, 11:19:32] Andie: I am a bit streteched due to how complicated im finding navigating this LAMPForge submission im doing, so might be quite slow in presenting the re-designs and tickets we discussed but I am hoping to have something for latest Monday for you to feedback on, based off the last convo we had.
[29/08/2025, 14:09:55] Andie: you can learn more about it from FireShip, who was doing a bit of promo on it on his most recent  videos:

[01/09/2025, 13:10:53] Fizzy: Wow!! This is great news Andie. Congratulations!!
[01/09/2025, 13:10:53] Fizzy: Please keep us posted on things, so we can plan ahead
[01/09/2025, 13:10:53] Fizzy: Do you have a submission now?
[01/09/2025, 13:10:54] Fizzy: In other news guys, AWS has approved our application and validated us as a startup. Now, we can press ahead with applying for the AWS credits
[01/09/2025, 13:52:34] Andie: Yeah man i have a submission to make by before 22nd Sept but before that they make u attend a compulsory webinar to ensure that u do the stage correctly as they dont want u to waster their time in the way u give responses so that was Friday during the day had to make it work. 2 hrs.
[01/09/2025, 13:53:41] Andie: Then i have one with their solicitors around Intellectual Property that will be 1hr. And that is suppose to help you fill the intellectual property part. They technically want you to be fit for purpose and assess whether u are at stage where they would want to back you replacing your salary with the programme. Year long.
[01/09/2025, 13:53:53] Andie: Yess lets goo🙌🙌

[04/09/2025, 12:16:10] Andie: Thank you bro🙏 journey of a thousand miles beginning with this step
[24/09/2025, 12:44:01] Andie: Another opportunity of a life time! Hope you gents are good ! @⁨Fizzy⁩  @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ at least 99% of your API work for Hotels resolved this way, 

https://travel-lite-hackathon.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover&_gl=1*desczc*_ga*Mzk2MjcyMjY2LjE3NTgyNjgzMDA.

The hackathon project can be a demonstration of a subset of GetAway's capabilities. It's a vertical slice.

*Strategy*: Build the hackathon submission as a minimal, standalone project focused only on the hotel ranking/recommendation problem using Nuitée LiteAPI. Do not include any code or logic for other parts of GetAway (e.g., full group management, complex multi-component trip planning, integration with all your external APIs/KG).

*Modular* *Architecture*: Your "GetAway Travel Agent Gateway" is modular. For the hackathon, you're open-sourcing the "Hotel Search Specialist" MCP server/adapter. This is one module, not the whole system.

*Licensing*: Include an explicit permissive open-source license (like MIT or Apache 2.0, if allowed by hackathon rules, as opposed to AGPL-3.0 for SearXNG, which is a ) in your GitHub repo for the submission. The hackathon states "must include an open source license."

*Documentation* *Focus*: The submission's text description and video should highlight the problem it solves and the impact, rather than revealing the proprietary internal workings of your larger GetAway system. Focus on the output quality (ranked hotel options with rationales) and user benefit.

*Use of Open-Source Base Models*: For the LLM component in the hackathon project, use a publicly available model (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma 3, or even a smaller Phi-4) rather than a custom-trained, proprietary SLM. The focus is on the agentic application of the LLM. Or well just Gemini isn't it! ‎<This message was edited>
[24/09/2025, 12:44:13] Andie: @⁨Fizzy⁩  You will keep the IP for GetAway's full, comprehensive AI agent system. The "novel creation" you open-source for the hackathon will be a focused, high-quality "Hotel Search Specialist" sub-agent/module, demonstrating core aspects of your "Intelligent Planning Logic" and "Constraint Engineering" applied to hotels. 

This showcases your expertise and attracts attention, while keeping the majority of your strategic moat (orchestration, KG, full data flywheel, other specialized SLMs, your unique end-to-end UI) private. ‎<This message was edited>
[24/09/2025, 13:01:53] Andie: Direct access and feedback from Google and Nuitée engineers/product leaders will be invaluable for refining our solution and exploring future partnership opportunities; getting their eyes on our specialised AI is huge. To say the least @⁨Fizzy⁩ so long as your and Jo's capacity allows it @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩
[24/09/2025, 13:02:14] Andie: *There's a €18,000 cash prize pool* (+ weekend getaways (oh! the irony😂😂)), with €10k for 1st place. Winning this would provide crucial, non-dilutive funding for GetAway.

Industry Validation: A win, or even strong performance, provides immense industry recognition, boosting our profile for investors and future partners. ‎<This message was edited>

[22/12/2025, 12:34:34] Jo (Naija - BLW): Hello Getaway people
[22/12/2025, 12:37:16] Fizzy: 👀
[22/12/2025, 12:37:45] Andie: Hello fellas👀
[22/12/2025, 12:37:49] Andie: Chai long time
[22/12/2025, 12:39:39] Jo (Naija - BLW): Ikr
[22/12/2025, 12:39:45] Jo (Naija - BLW): Possible resuscitation?
[22/12/2025, 12:39:53] Andie: 💯
[22/12/2025, 12:50:41] Andie: Unfortunately ive had a bit of high and lows with my health so that’s been sidetracking me a bit and also doing a few odd jobs. Its been one hell of a market this year. So ngl its been a lot!
[22/12/2025, 12:50:44] Andie: How u been?
[22/12/2025, 13:32:08] Fizzy: Yes please!🙌🏾🙌🏾
[22/12/2025, 13:32:33] Fizzy: So sorry to hear that bro. How are you feeling now?
[22/12/2025, 13:32:50] Andie: Yeah gradually getting there
[22/12/2025, 13:33:14] Andie: I have a form of blood malformation which means i get a lot more tired physically and cognitively than usual
[22/12/2025, 13:33:57] Andie: If people of black decent can bave Sickle C and becaus eof it be very sick i have varient that isnt life threatening but is known as Type C
[22/12/2025, 13:35:23] Fizzy: Oh God! I’m sos sorry to hear this. Is there anything we can do to help?
[22/12/2025, 13:35:48] Fizzy: Do you think you’ll be able to resume on Getaway?
[22/12/2025, 13:35:59] Andie: I am just trying to accelerate being seen by a specialist and compensating nutrionally cause i easily get into nutritional deficit
[22/12/2025, 13:36:35] Andie: Like atm Vitamin D
[22/12/2025, 13:36:47] Andie: Yeah but will have to bear with me on which aspecrs
[22/12/2025, 13:36:58] Andie: it basically like makes me very anemic as well ‎<This message was edited>
[22/12/2025, 13:37:04] Fizzy: Do you need to take supplements and stuff?
[22/12/2025, 13:37:42] Andie: Yeah but in more severe high doses to be able to be baseline energised/energetic
[22/12/2025, 13:37:46] Fizzy: That’s okay bro. We can take things slow. I got a new job in September and that has pretty much been taking much of my time as well
[22/12/2025, 13:37:55] Fizzy: Oh wow!
[22/12/2025, 13:38:17] Andie: Its more to do with energy management so i have to be extremely careful how i spent my energy tank each day
[22/12/2025, 13:38:29] Andie: Oh thats amazing man!! Congratss
[22/12/2025, 13:39:38] Andie: I just double down on my Technical Product Management experience and tried to break into Cyber a little bit more cause i wanted to bring that to the Getaway team, within my PM training there’s still obvs a lot of UI and UX research thats part and parcel of it so that’s why im covering so much but like i said times before my focus has been conceptual redesign.
[22/12/2025, 13:41:06] Andie: OpenAI has introduced some interesting SDK (to have like in line cards and other things within a conversational chatbot interface so you dont context switch when compring options) standards within the chatbot paradigm that we discussed we wanted to maintain from my previous prototypes so i was working on implementing such an also understand better whether Front End could be refactored to React Native since I am not well versed in the language u used for the original mobile app ‎<This message was edited>
[22/12/2025, 13:41:21] Andie: That’s me pretty much, @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ what u saying?
[22/12/2025, 13:43:01] Andie: And how you getting on? Has that upskilled you more?
[22/12/2025, 13:57:16] Fizzy: Yeah it has 100%. It is very much adjacent to AI development. It’s still full stack engineering, but we work mainly with LLMs. Just last week, I was building an AI agent that retrieves and summarises news articles
[22/12/2025, 14:00:49] Andie: Oh nice!! Love that u can earn and learn and that re-invest in what our discussion have been at for the past months etc. i haven’t forgotten my action items btw and the whole approach we choose to go for for the Jira board, just this health stuff ngl they have sucked a whole lot and hit me quite badly. It was one thing accepting it as is and another looking for genuine solutions. 

I am on heavy meds to return to baseline but they told me i would see improvement until i succeefully did the entire course of meds which is about 4 months. Im at month 2 I think now.
[22/12/2025, 14:07:48] Fizzy: I wish you a speedy recovery bro. I’ll be praying for you as well🙏🏾
[22/12/2025, 14:08:20] Andie: Appreciate you man🙏
[22/12/2025, 14:08:24] Fizzy: Shall we meet up later today to re align ourselves and pick up from where we left off?
[22/12/2025, 14:09:59] Andie: Yeah we can do if u guys can manage. Ill write my agenda of things to report on. So its a bit more formalised and we have a shared reality of the state of things. ‎<This message was edited>

[22/12/2025, 20:05:40] Fizzy: @⁨Andie⁩ It's seems builder itself doesn't allow you to convert to flutter, but you can use a builder plugin called visual copilot in Figma to cpnvert a figma design to flutter code
[22/12/2025, 20:08:17] Andie: oh okay thats really good to know
[22/12/2025, 20:08:30] Andie: found that so weird tho cause its literally in their marketing blurb

[22/12/2025, 20:41:57] Andie: btw this is the main "Anatomy" of GetAway as of now and the last deck was a more granular variations, each preserves some level of attention to detail to what retain a user or what would make them churn. There was also a lot of ideation of temporarily having a Progressive Web App version so that it would be a lot easier to programme for myself at least before then deep diving into engineering the front end with hopefully Builder.io helping a lot in that.

Just some thoughts, checking out. Speak soon.

[24/12/2025, 14:04:31] Andie: We are getting there
[24/12/2025, 14:05:12] Andie: Just finished developing the GetAway SDK which was conceptually extracted from OpenAI’s philosophy of AI as Operating System
[24/12/2025, 14:05:30] Andie: U can learn more about it here, if u have any contribution to make pls lmk

[24/12/2025, 14:07:19] Andie: Will eventually get it to this version for mobile but this basically the Chat-Overlay idea
[24/12/2025, 14:08:43] Andie: The front end architecture is then better explained in this demo and the SDK: 

This in essence then goes as far as creating a marketplace for GetAway for others to want to be plugged basically what OpenAI is doing with Apps SDK and giving it up to developers to bring third party experience into the app
[24/12/2025, 14:08:59] Andie: In our case it will be prefilled booking com or expedia and u name it
[24/12/2025, 14:10:15] Andie: DoorDash recently also created a similar experience: https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/doordash-rolls-out-zesty-an-ai-social-app-for-discovering-new-restaurants/
[24/12/2025, 14:11:05] Andie: So our GetAway AI Guided Social Travel Planning App will be definitely hopefully obliterated competition

[24/12/2025, 14:23:58] Andie: GetAway SDK UI - which was what I had been missing since it takes us to a new visual spatial Human Computer Interaction paradigm.

 https://openai.github.io/apps-sdk-ui/?path=/docs/overview-introduction--docs
[24/12/2025, 14:32:46] Andie: our GetAway "Agent-Driven Graphical Interface" that I said just intuitively was missing from the initial wireframes. But was trying to demo here

Part 1 of the Conversational UI and SDK paradigm

https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxNt2M_YRWe_ue8rfGEA3dXf-YprQlyCrH?si=1XD4KAP9z6iKV3HP
[24/12/2025, 14:34:42] Andie: Here. I call it🙏back then, although that’s a future For You page for travel implementation as at the moment aggregation and Dora are the “core” of GetAway. But the join link wit credits that lead to the user joining are also of outmost importance to collapse the conversion rate funnel and all those who have been on the fence and put of from the first GetAway version. ‎<This message was edited>
[24/12/2025, 14:37:53] Andie: The mental model upgrade from your original idea is that in a Conversational SDK UI, the Aggregation happens as a byproduct of the conversation

And this SDK becomes proprietary tech for you @⁨Fizzy⁩

So doing capturing the "Psychological Truth" thanks to well done NLP pipelines and a bit of Computer Vision as well as Social Graphs before the social pressure of the group ruins the data.

Just doing aggregation as average was a bit too short-lived with all that the technology allows even from a recommender system point of view and what Netflix uses to tell what a User want to watch next type tech. I know MLOps can be very deep tech and strenuous. ‎<This message was edited>

[29/12/2025, 16:21:19] Andie: yeah am good with that Fizzy
[29/12/2025, 16:21:28] Andie: life of a scale up worker
[29/12/2025, 16:21:33] Andie: thought u was even on a holidays break
[29/12/2025, 16:21:38] Andie: fairr nough bud
[29/12/2025, 16:22:38] Andie: evening! yeah all good here, i am in https://storybook.js.org/

implementing the GateWay design system paradigms and primitives
[29/12/2025, 16:23:00] Andie: AI UI/UX but most importantly the onboarding flows
[29/12/2025, 16:23:46] Andie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyNIspWhFyU
[29/12/2025, 16:26:31] Andie: And you? So far so good?
[30/12/2025, 14:22:44] Fizzy: Hi guys are we all good for 6:30pm today? @⁨Andie⁩ @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩
[30/12/2025, 14:45:35] Andie: If @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ is well enough, i am down for it no p
[30/12/2025, 14:45:49] Andie: All good on my side so far
[30/12/2025, 15:28:32] Fizzy: @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩?
[30/12/2025, 15:29:04] Fizzy: Also guys, please let’s not forget to populate the jira board with what we’re working on
[30/12/2025, 15:29:25] Jo (Naija - BLW): Sup bro! Can we do tomorrow please. Out with family today
[30/12/2025, 15:30:05] Jo (Naija - BLW): Or we can meet very late
[30/12/2025, 15:30:25] Fizzy: Tomorrow will be difficult cos it is NYE
[30/12/2025, 15:30:31] Andie: Can do very late
[30/12/2025, 15:30:34] Andie: Nye
[30/12/2025, 15:30:36] Andie: For me as well
[30/12/2025, 15:31:55] Fizzy: Actually, can we do this async instead? The whole point of meeting is to discuss what we’ll be working on for the next two weeks, but we can just say on here. No need to make a big deal out of it
[30/12/2025, 15:33:31] Andie: Yeah thats calm
[30/12/2025, 15:35:24] Fizzy: I’m working on migrating Dora to a multi agent architecture. Currently, Dora is set up as one agent searching for flights, hotels and events. This greatly increases latency, so this sprint I’ll be breaking Dora down into multiple agents so we can run each of these tasks in parallel and have an orchestrator agent that delegates tasks based on the user’s request.
[30/12/2025, 15:35:57] Andie: Can i please have the api endpoints access u gave a while back as well
[30/12/2025, 15:36:05] Andie: Im mapping out some things on the front end
[30/12/2025, 15:36:21] Andie: Id imagine ur architectural design are all gonna be updated too
[30/12/2025, 15:36:49] Andie: Yeah u did say, so makes perfect sense. Sub-agent talking to mothership.
[30/12/2025, 15:41:50] Fizzy: You can find all the currently deployed endpoints here: https://getaway-backend.onrender.com/swagger-ui/index.html
[30/12/2025, 15:42:10] Andie: ahh fab thats where they were
[30/12/2025, 15:42:12] Andie: thanks
[30/12/2025, 15:42:34] Andie: so this aint loked down, its on the open web?
[30/12/2025, 15:42:48] Andie: that means that someone can scan it and find it exist on the open web...
[30/12/2025, 15:42:56] Andie: just food for thought @⁨Fizzy⁩
[30/12/2025, 15:52:23] Fizzy: You’re right. At the moment, there is not much to it, but when we’re releasing Dora, we’ll have to redeploy the user management part as a private service
[30/12/2025, 15:52:53] Andie: no worries will keep keepin this hush hush
[30/12/2025, 15:52:55] Andie: gotcha
[30/12/2025, 16:23:36] Jo (Naija - BLW): Im working on a skeletal evaluation of the multi agent system
[05/01/2026, 11:14:27] Fizzy: Morning guys, how are we doing? Happy new year!
[05/01/2026, 11:16:01] Fizzy: Just wanted to remind you guys we’re meeting next week Monday to showcase our progress on what we’ve been working on and to plan for the next sprint.

[12/01/2026, 15:15:14] Fizzy: Just a remainder we’ll be meeting today to sync up and plan next moves.
[12/01/2026, 15:15:25] Fizzy: How does 6pm sound for everyone?
[12/01/2026, 15:20:02] Andie: Yeah that can works, sorry these past weeks have neen interesting to say the list not been much on my A game
[12/01/2026, 15:20:20] Andie: But good to go with this all
[12/01/2026, 16:53:29] Fizzy: Nice to hear!!
[12/01/2026, 16:54:05] Fizzy: How about you @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩?
[12/01/2026, 17:55:13] Andie: Hey Fizzy im cool with tomorrow as well if that can work a bit better for us, ngl, feel a bit wiped out tonight but was gonna try update our asynch dashboard of things with my own progrss notes etc
[12/01/2026, 18:05:49] Fizzy: Let’s do a quick sync up call. I don’t have much to update on either, but I think it is good we check in and see where we’re at with things
[12/01/2026, 18:06:00] Fizzy: Let’s meet here https://meet.google.com/enr-jmcn-nhe
[12/01/2026, 18:06:35] Andie: Aight cool, be joining u now

[12/01/2026, 19:04:39] Fizzy: Yeah, I like this.
[12/01/2026, 19:04:45] Andie: But it has the key primatives
[12/01/2026, 19:04:58] Fizzy: Thanks, I’ll check it out
[12/01/2026, 19:05:07] Andie: For events and the other stuff the view is this
[12/01/2026, 19:06:47] Andie: No worries, i know there’s been a lot of conceptualisation but the visual spatial idea of what this ai ui would have become eventually i can see its slowly making its way from the bigger players so its definitely great opportunity for us to OWN the category for best in travel UI and UX derive from merging a few of these primitives. A lot of it already respects user habits and intentions and has the solicitation cues
[12/01/2026, 19:09:13] Andie: finally highly recommend this paper both @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ @⁨Fizzy⁩

[25/01/2026, 19:59:06] Andie: Hi gents! I have been working on this for a while cause it affect my UX workflows and human computer interactions, so just to get out of my mind could you kindly review it, I have given it to you into a pretty straightforward prezzy, it basically turns Dora into an hypervisor, so its doing virtualisation at the layer between the orchestrator what Fizzy as already build and the entire causal space of seraching for flights, resolving for several constraints but its wraps it all up under pre-determined so it become deterministic rather than hoping that the agent "picks" the right tools, this is know as neurosymbolic AI, i've written at length in our GitHub as a SOTA (state of the art) repo which has all conclusive industry Technological Readiness Level, and this is pretty mature stuff as it complements the following the attached.

if you want to play with the real thing of the onboarding, any feedback.

It has just some steps missing to reduce the amount of information the user as to give to start on Dora, like we discussed last year give them a taste then get them to sign in to continue and rate limiting wherever it makes sense.

You best zoom out on mobile as responsiviness is a bit broken but dsktop can be viewed better.

[25/01/2026, 21:41:21] Andie: Dora Hypervisor...guys..just to be plain..sit one level above the hardware (LLMs) and one level below the userland (Applications).

"Human-in-the-loop" vs. "Protocol-in-the-loop"

the Why we are set apart, cause you got to think of it this way...LangGraph might decide to "Book a Flight," but it is the Dora Protocol that checks if that flight lands before the group's dinner in Lisbon and rejects the move if physics says no.

it was Nvidia opensourcing their self-driving car that gave me this final resolution to the stack puzzle, an Hypervisor abstraction, listen here, following the principle of  Chain of Causation reasoning with trajectory planning to enhance decision-making in complex driving scenarios but also travelling as we need Dora to be spatial aware.

https://youtube.com/shorts/UWLcwJj4XmE?si=zSIH1jT37nuYtSKm

here's the papers that confirm is possibile cause LLMs have generalised "common-sense" therefore if well constrained can reliably control cars, UI interface, computers. Nvidia is like the best in the field in LLMOps, so Jo @⁨Jo (Naija - BLW)⁩ ur evals will defo be accurate deriving from them.

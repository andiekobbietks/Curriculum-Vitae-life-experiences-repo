[07/06/2023, 13:11:49] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): Fab!
[07/06/2023, 13:11:56] Andie: Well behaved so its been so far so good
[07/06/2023, 15:07:19] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): Hope it all went well today..see you tomorrow at birchgrove primary? They are keen to start at 9.30 if you can get there by then? Thank you!
[07/06/2023, 15:48:12] Andie: Hi Laura, we literally just finished and set off, seeing this now, it did indeed go surprisingly well, given the well-behaved pupils.

I wanted to bring to your attention some issues we encountered during the Lego Spike activities. It seems that a few of the Lego robots were still partially built and were not properly disassembled beforehand. This has caused some disruptions and delays in our sessions with the kids.

I appreciate that things have been quite busy lately, but I wanted to highlight the impact this has had on our delivery and keeping up with troubleshooting. When the Lego structures are not fully disassembled, it takes significant additional time for the kids to dismantle them, which slows down the overall progress of our activities, as they never done it before. It becomes a bit challenging to manage the situation efficiently and keep up with the planned schedule.

To help alleviate this issue,  emphasising the importance of fully disassembling the Lego structures after each activity.
[07/06/2023, 15:48:22] Andie: We’ll be there by then thanks
[07/06/2023, 15:48:30] Andie: Just confirmed with Eshan
[07/06/2023, 16:01:12] Andie: @⁨Laura Roberts (Technocamps)⁩
[07/06/2023, 16:02:23] Andie: Travelling with him
[07/06/2023, 16:04:56] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): Thank you, and I agree re.the Lego. If it was all taken apart today then should be fine for tomorrow. Sometimes they need checking straight after a workshop, but we've been out of the office so much, I agree the kits need a bit of sorting. Catch up tomorrow 👍 see you at 9.30
[08/06/2023, 06:01:25] Andie: Good morning, @⁨Laura Roberts (Technocamps)⁩! Thank you for your acknowledgment. That’s right, we’ve been on the road a lot. I can absolutely make it a point to go through them, however, as soon as possible when the opportunity arises to do so in the office, and you give me the green light 🟢. Looking forward to catching up with later today😊 me and Eshan should be getting there at 9:30 too

Hiya Laura,

Just wondering if you had a feedback form so I can highly praise your amazing session from last week. All the kids absolutely loved it and keep asking when you are coming in next. It was the most engaged I have ever seen them in a technocamp session so thank you so very much.

Our year 5's have started creating their competition robot and are very excited for the 13th July. I will drop a message to the organisers to make sure we have been added and so i can find out some more details.

A big thank you to your amazing team from all of us at Birchgrove,

Rachel

[27/06/2023, 14:48:37] Andie: further**
[27/06/2023, 14:49:51] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): We have the tablets on loan to cyberfirst on the 4th, but if they have chrome books we can use the software on, and you and Eshan are available, that would be fine. I am on AL that day.
[27/06/2023, 14:50:10] Andie: Alright I’ll inform them accordingly thanks
[27/06/2023, 14:50:35] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): 👍

[28/06/2023, 13:17:55] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): If I need you to take just the tablets and chargers back, then would you mind doing that, please?
[28/06/2023, 13:18:33] Andie: Yeah that’s okay I’ll bring them back with me in a bag and collect charges from Eshan
[28/06/2023, 13:19:00] Andie: Will confirm with him in a min a let you know, will u be in the office for me to drop by by hopefully 4pm?
[28/06/2023, 13:19:12] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Brilliant. Thank you. How are you travelling back? Will it be a problem for you to take the tablets?
[28/06/2023, 13:19:58] Andie: Hopefully it should be, Ive got 10 tablets if I get a good shopping bag I should be able to carry them and hop on a train
[28/06/2023, 13:20:55] Andie: I think I’ll manage @⁨Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps)⁩, I’ll see u then
[28/06/2023, 13:21:33] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Thank you. Aren’t they in a bag or something already?
[28/06/2023, 13:22:20] Andie: Eshan carried them in a backpack today for easier portability so will check with him in a bit whether there is another bad he had
[28/06/2023, 13:22:31] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): 👍
[28/06/2023, 13:25:05] Andie: Its the timing good for you?if there aren’t any distruption that would be my ETA
[28/06/2023, 13:36:22] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I have to leave the office before then, but I will leave the store room on the latch, so that you can go in and leave the tablets in there, please.
Is that okay?
[28/06/2023, 13:44:07] Andie: Yeah absolutely fine with me, will leave them on the table
[28/06/2023, 14:11:17] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Thank you very much!
[28/06/2023, 14:12:02] Andie: Not a problem!
[28/06/2023, 14:15:51] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): 🙏
[28/06/2023, 15:35:34] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): @⁨Andie⁩, the storeroom door is in the latch, so you’ll be able to just go straight in.
[28/06/2023, 15:38:42] Andie: Nice one! Thanks I am on my way back just stuck in traffic
[28/06/2023, 15:43:24] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Okay. You didn’t catch the train, did you?
[28/06/2023, 15:58:56] Andie: No cause of the awful train distruption, so taxi it this time
[28/06/2023, 15:59:15] Andie: I’ve almost reached
‎[28/06/2023, 16:12:35] Andie: ‎image omitted
[28/06/2023, 16:13:09] Andie: Done and dusted @⁨Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps)⁩ Undone the latch, and it’s locked.
[28/06/2023, 16:13:51] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Brilliant. Thank you so much!!!
[28/06/2023, 16:16:20] Andie: I’m afraid but Eshan needed the main black chargin station so that’s with him for the lego bricks, but I see fairly enough chargers in here so hopefully those should do. This bag has all the 10 tablets, I’ve been keeping one lego prime kit with me with a tablet for a while to play around with it and learn. That’s about it, your most welcome @⁨Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps)⁩ see you soon! Good to have you back!
[28/06/2023, 16:17:14] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Thank you.

[18/07/2023, 09:04:00] Eshan Fernando: Good Morning Laura ✨ Will Do 💯 could you kindly let me know of the time that you will be in the office?
[18/07/2023, 09:08:23] Andie: Good morning @⁨Laura Roberts (Technocamps)⁩ I’ll absolutely do but unfortunately, the agenda looking quite quiet for this week I committed to work for the Graduation several weeks ago so I’ll not be able until at least Monday next week, cause I am full on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday with exception of today. Really sorry about that and leaving Eshan all the work.
[18/07/2023, 09:15:54] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): No problem Andie, thanks for letting me know and enjoy working at graduation!
[18/07/2023, 09:23:45] Andie: Thanks for your understanding @⁨Laura Roberts (Technocamps)⁩ will be certainly back to support more in getting through the sorting out needed as soon as I am back from all of that ofcos
[18/07/2023, 16:42:16] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): @⁨Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps)⁩ what time are you planning to be in the office tomorrow Rhys? I will be picking up some Lego kits in the morning.
[18/07/2023, 21:55:23] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I’m hoping sometime between 9am and 10am.
[18/07/2023, 22:00:05] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I won’t be able to be there for that long, though, as I have something that I need to get back home for.
[18/07/2023, 22:55:29] Eshan Fernando: I’ll be there by 9-9.15✨
[19/07/2023, 09:20:25] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I’m in the office, just to let you know, @⁨Eshan Fernando⁩ and @⁨Andie⁩.
[02/08/2023, 14:31:18] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): @⁨Andie⁩, we need to use the laptops on Monday and Tuesday. Are they all okay and ready to use?
[02/08/2023, 14:40:15] Andie: @⁨Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps)⁩
[02/08/2023, 14:40:41] Andie: Hello Rhys! Sure, I can confirm that most laptops are running just fine, but they do need the latest security and patching updates for some of the computer internal components with outdated software, and finishing windows updating, the network last time I worked on them was just not fast enough, probably being busy edurom.

This has proven to be the most time-consuming part, so we need to continue updating, the manufacturer’s essentials, no features updates.

It might take a full day, at your earliest convenience, and mine, are you in the office in the upcoming days? That way, we can do a quick test run since it's going to be busy next week.

I've tested a few, and they connect, but I remember you suggested reverting back the Hub's software so they can stay compatible with the Tablets. 

This means that they won't talk to the laptops until re-updated. These are the limitations we are facing at the moment. However, for the rest, I can guarantee they will run smoothly. ‎<This message was edited>
[02/08/2023, 14:40:53] Andie: Happy to come see you now if you’re in the office?
[02/08/2023, 14:43:01] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): We don’t need to use the laptops with the LEGO kits.
We need to use the laptops for Scratch. As long as they are fine for Scratch, then that is okay.
[02/08/2023, 14:48:17] Andie: Oh yeah, it’s all good then. How many of them will be used? Due to the updates, I couldn’t finish adding Scratch to the actual app on most of them. So, it would be a few laptops having them; they need to be double-checked as updates have been taking up lots of resources, making multitasking difficult. Of course, an alternative is the web version, which will be fine as long as we have all the PCs correctly configured on the allowed network.
[02/08/2023, 14:48:53] Andie: I had to manually use my credentials last time
[02/08/2023, 14:50:21] Andie: I bumped into IT at the time too, who said it will require Laura’s putting a request to have them added to one of the secondary, isolated networks
[02/08/2023, 14:51:31] Andie: Im on campus so happy to pop over and check a few quickly.
[02/08/2023, 14:52:32] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): We just need Scratch on them, so that we can use Scratch next week, so are you able to check that? We are in the office now, if you are available now?
[02/08/2023, 14:53:24] Andie: Alrighty, yeah sure thing, will pop over now and have a quick look at them, no worries Rhys
‎[02/08/2023, 17:05:40] Andie: ‎image omitted
[03/08/2023, 18:43:24] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): Hi all, 
Cardiff have brand new Lego spik.kits that they will be using with laptops. 

Will we need to set up the spike bricks before we use them for the first time? 

Will they be able to use the laptop Bluetooth? 

If you could confirm this info, then I will know whether we need to take our kits (as it may be easier) to Cardiff next week. 

Cheers, Laura
[03/08/2023, 18:48:33] Andie: Hi @⁨Laura Roberts (Technocamps)⁩ 
You're exactly right, we will need to set up their Hubs by syncing them with our laptops initially via cable in order for the Hubs to receive updates. We'll then need to name the Hubs accordingly. If we use our own Hubs, we'll have to update ours as well so they work properly with the laptops. As I was explaining in a chat with @⁨Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps)⁩ Rhys Thomas Williams yesterday, I'm not sure if you and @⁨Eshan Fernando⁩ Eshan Fernando were able to revert some of the kits back to the tablet version of the Hub software. In either case, for assured compatibility, the Hub will always prompt you to "update", which is an offline process initiated when connecting a Hub to whatever desktop version of the Lego Spike app you're using. Otherwise, it will most definitely not work. ‎<This message was edited>
[03/08/2023, 18:51:26] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): Ok. I don't want to mix our Lego and Cardiff's, so think using our kits with the tablets (which Eshan has sorted to work with our Lego) might be the easiest option. Thanks Andie!
[03/08/2023, 18:52:49] Andie: No problem at all, yeah it will be sensible not to. You are right, and sure thing, I guess there won't be any other complications then if @⁨Eshan Fernando⁩ has already intervened. ‎<This message was edited>
[03/08/2023, 18:53:00] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): @eshan how many Lego bricks and tablets do we have that are sorted and working?
[03/08/2023, 18:53:29] Eshan Fernando: 15 lego hubs downgraded and compatible with the tablets
[03/08/2023, 18:53:54] Eshan Fernando: 4 more lego kits to sort.. I’ll do it tomorrow morning and we are all set
[03/08/2023, 18:54:05] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): Cool. Hopefully we have 15 tablets, can you bring the ones you have too? Brill. Thank you!
[03/08/2023, 18:54:44] Eshan Fernando: I returned all the equipment I borrowed to downgrade so everything should be in the storeroom💯
[03/08/2023, 18:57:17] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): If we are there early, then it should be a big problem to plug their bricks into their computers and update them ready for the session. We could plug them all in at the same time (assuming that they have enough computers?), and then just let them update.
What about doing that?
[03/08/2023, 19:02:04] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): We're using the laptops they have most of Monday, and we're at the museum Tuesday morning, but someone could do the updates to the Lego Tuesday morning (maybe Rhys and Eshan) as I think we'll have enough staff to supervise the trip...
[03/08/2023, 19:02:42] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): When is the LEGO session?
[03/08/2023, 19:03:00] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): 1.30-3 on Tuesday
[03/08/2023, 19:03:37] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Okay, so we could get them sorted sometime on Monday, then. If not, I can pick up our LEGO on Tuesday morning.
[03/08/2023, 19:07:33] Laura Roberts (Technocamps): We'd have to do it after the kids go home on Monday?
[03/08/2023, 20:19:32] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Yes, or before the sessions, or one of us could take a laptop and work on them throughout the day?
[04/08/2023, 10:01:31] Eshan Fernando: Hi, could you kindly let me know if anyone is available at the office today for me to come and sort out the remaining lego kits please?
[04/08/2023, 10:01:54] Eshan Fernando: @⁨Laura Roberts (Technocamps)⁩
[04/08/2023, 10:06:03] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I’m in the office.
[04/08/2023, 12:30:14] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): @⁨Andie⁩, have you got any of the yellow tablets?

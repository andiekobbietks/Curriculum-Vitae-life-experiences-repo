[03/07/2023, 11:54:33] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Hi Andie.
This is Rhys.
When you arranged the session for tomorrow, did they ask for the afternoon, as it would be better if we can go in the morning?
[03/07/2023, 12:01:13] Andie: Hello Rhys they did please ask for afternoon
[03/07/2023, 12:01:58] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Okay. Was there any reason? I’m going to contact them and see if they prefer the morning, as it makes it easier for us.
[03/07/2023, 12:03:10] Andie: Yeah you’re right! I think because of the class that they wanted to teach to, I think they are on in the afternoon, otherwise I dont really see any other reason she would have us in at that period of time
[03/07/2023, 12:03:36] Andie: Is there any chance I could go along with you from Trefforest or even any where I could stop in Cardiff that is on your way pls?
[03/07/2023, 12:03:59] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Do you remember the name of the teacher that asked for the session?
[03/07/2023, 12:04:05] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Yes, that’s fine.
[03/07/2023, 12:04:26] Andie: Last time what I did was to go up to Dinas Powys
[03/07/2023, 12:04:33] Andie: And got picked by Eshan
[03/07/2023, 12:04:47] Andie: Let me look if I can get you the name of that particular teacher pls
[03/07/2023, 12:05:08] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I’ll pick you up in the university, as I’ll need to collect the equipment.
[03/07/2023, 12:05:23] Andie: She did tell me that she wasnt the direct contact to us and there was an intermediary
[03/07/2023, 12:05:34] Andie: So I’ll go on and get her name and come right back to you
[03/07/2023, 12:06:03] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Ryan is the teacher we’ve been in touch with.
Do you know what year group they want for tomorrow?
[03/07/2023, 12:11:56] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I just rand and they want to keep it for 1pm to 3pm.
[03/07/2023, 12:14:21] Andie: Oh okay sure it’s Year 4
[03/07/2023, 12:14:36] Andie: Oh okay, yeah I’d thought so
[03/07/2023, 12:16:09] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): 👍
[03/07/2023, 16:28:34] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Were all of the LEGO robots working last week, including the 2 new ones that were used, please? Had they all been updated?
[03/07/2023, 16:36:01] Andie: Yea pls they all been updated and do work, so long as they are fully charged
[03/07/2023, 16:36:22] Andie: The app is presently a bit outdate but is the only one that will work with our 2016 Android tablets
[03/07/2023, 16:36:34] Andie: So just a bit slow in refreshing things at this point
[03/07/2023, 16:36:38] Andie: Thats about it
[03/07/2023, 16:36:40] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Great. Thank you.

We will be using the school’s computers, anyway.
[03/07/2023, 17:05:25] Andie: Yeah that’s right their Chromebook through the web version which should be a hassle free experience
[03/07/2023, 17:42:50] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Hopefully! I haven’t used them with Chromebooks before.
[03/07/2023, 17:43:02] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Do you know is Eshan is coming tomorrow?
[03/07/2023, 17:43:31] Andie: Me and Eshan did, so my way around it

[03/07/2023, 22:47:55] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I may need some help sorting the LEGO boxes out in the morning, if you are available?
They are in a mess.
[04/07/2023, 07:26:43] Andie: Sure thing Rhys, will be happy to help, when should I pop by?
[04/07/2023, 07:27:07] Andie: Yeah they’ve been in a bit of a state for a while now
[04/07/2023, 07:50:45] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I’ll text you when I get there, but I’m aiming to be there at around 9am.

[05/07/2023, 10:23:29] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I’m in the office.
[05/07/2023, 10:23:50] Andie: On my way to you now, see you shortly
[05/07/2023, 10:23:51] Andie: Thanks
[07/07/2023, 08:32:45] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I should be in the office by around 10am today.
[07/07/2023, 08:41:22] Andie: Oh right!! Morning, excellent news! The laptop I took handled the changes well so will be good to get through the rest
[07/07/2023, 08:42:16] Andie: Will try get through it all by 2pm Rhys
[07/07/2023, 08:49:04] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): You don’t need to get them all done today. It’s fine to just spend a couple of hours each day, for a few days, to get them all done.
[07/07/2023, 08:51:01] Andie: Oh okay good to know, I’ll likely spend 4 hrs on them today then
[07/07/2023, 08:51:05] Andie: See how I get on
[14/07/2023, 10:23:27] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I’m in the office.

[18/01/2024, 08:13:28] Andie: There’s next door two so could potentially get more chair from there if need be, otherwise so far so good
[18/01/2024, 08:16:09] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Great. On my way.
[18/01/2024, 08:16:39] Andie: About the Wifi, I just thought Ill probably hand my IT support one out or otherwise u are still in time to check with reception at the Ty Crawshay, as they may have those Open days wifi access card
‎[18/01/2024, 08:20:20] Andie: ‎image omitted
[18/01/2024, 08:20:32] Andie: Just need to test them tho
[18/01/2024, 08:20:41] Andie: From the Conference Centre by Stills
[18/01/2024, 08:52:33] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): 🎉

[18/01/2024, 08:53:39] Andie: Oh gosh
[18/01/2024, 08:54:49] Andie: But I think we’ll be fine
[18/01/2024, 08:55:31] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Do those cards work?
[18/01/2024, 08:55:49] Andie: Yeah still testing them with one of the candidates
[18/01/2024, 08:56:07] Andie: I already got an account so I am letting them having a go
[18/01/2024, 08:56:26] Andie: Its quite straightforward to be fair, all explained on the card ‎<This message was edited>
[19/01/2024, 16:23:23] Andie: Hello Rhys, I forgot to circle back to you that after going back to the conference centres the officers there, told me to keep all the Wifi cards to ourselves and that these could be requested from IT but they werent sure of the polices around it and also that, these will work again with anyone else who is gonna be a future guest and need temporary access as that code doesnt change.
[19/01/2024, 16:23:50] Andie: I am going to be sending you my planning hours and the yesterday’s as well
[20/01/2024, 19:07:24] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): That’s brilliant. Thank you!
[30/01/2024, 13:18:40] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Do you still have those Open Day cards, please?
Please can you send me a picture of one, to use on the laptops?
[30/01/2024, 13:35:58] Andie: Sure I do
[30/01/2024, 13:36:13] Andie: Let me get a hold of it now
‎[30/01/2024, 13:46:47] Andie: ‎image omitted
[30/01/2024, 13:47:07] Andie: Hope this goes a long way Rhys here u go
[30/01/2024, 21:38:55] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Thank you.
[31/01/2024, 08:46:29] Andie: Very welcome Rhys
[21/02/2024, 12:53:50] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Is everything okay for tomorrow?

Do you want to use my laptop for the Dreamweaver?

Do those Internet cards still work?
[21/02/2024, 15:47:01] Andie: Yes pls they do, and sorry I had network issues in class so my email did not send off
[21/02/2024, 15:47:07] Andie: But so fae so good
[21/02/2024, 16:02:30] Andie: I am gonna try again after class
[21/02/2024, 16:02:49] Andie: If you dint mind Id be great to have ur dreamweaver as back up
[21/02/2024, 16:03:02] Andie: I managed to get it fairly functional on my to showcase things
‎[21/02/2024, 16:03:56] Andie: ‎image omitted
[21/02/2024, 16:04:03] Andie: Ive got over this hurdle
[21/02/2024, 16:07:56] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): Okay. As long as you’ve got something the demonstrate on, then that’s fine. I’ll try to help as much as I can, but I am not confident with it, so I’ll have to watch what you are doing and then see what I can do.
[21/02/2024, 16:40:23] Andie: Yeah it wont be at a great level of complexity I am really coming with prebuilt components and then walking through the builds, dipping in and out as needed
[21/02/2024, 16:40:49] Andie: Thats the idea but will be using mostly visual studio cose and Dreamweaver interchangeably
[22/02/2024, 09:04:44] Andie: Morning Rhys! Will see you soon. Just heading to the room now.
[22/02/2024, 09:15:46] Rhys Thomas Williams (Technocamps): I’m in the room. Are you close?
[22/02/2024, 09:23:03] Andie: I am already here, but theres only one person so far
[01/05/2025, 13:14:27] Andie: Hello Rhys I just realised that I actually have your contact. I am 15min away. Just at Treforst Estate at the minute.

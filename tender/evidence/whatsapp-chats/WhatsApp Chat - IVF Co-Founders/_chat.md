[28/10/2025, 11:14:19] Hope: @⁨Andie⁩ @⁨~Sam⁩  my suggestions for website soundtrack
[28/10/2025, 11:14:28] Hope: Very low volume
[28/10/2025, 11:14:47] Andie: Mine be coming through soon pls bear in mind copyright
[28/10/2025, 11:16:56] Hope: Do they say anything different if they are safe to use?
‎[28/10/2025, 11:19:13] Hope: ‎image omitted
[28/10/2025, 11:25:03] Andie: Pls fill me in a bit more about willbe able to advise better then.
[28/10/2025, 11:30:31] Hope: Oh sorry the clinic that gave me an assessment accepted to do a 45 minute webinar on ADHD and one of their lead psychiatrists will be leading it. 

They are happy to do it for feee but they also want guarantee in numbers. So they were asking if charging £5/10 would be a way to guarantee people showing up?  They want about 30 people. 

And if we charge they are willing to donate to the charity
[28/10/2025, 11:31:25] Hope: My mind wants to charge then we can pay for someone’s assessment with them?
[28/10/2025, 11:31:35] Hope: Idk what you guys think?
[28/10/2025, 13:32:17] ~ Sam: I will reply once I am free
[28/10/2025, 13:42:06] Andie: I think it would really guarantee the predictability of attendance a bit more if you especially make it feel almost like free and emphasise say that is the cost of a startbuck copy pls if they want to run promo this way as well. Lots of people are trying to get diagnosed so
[28/10/2025, 13:48:22] Hope: Noted
[28/10/2025, 14:00:25] Andie: Yeah thats sound cause its also making people respect the value given not braking anynone bank
[28/10/2025, 14:00:47] Andie: but it would be a good exercise in building financial traction for donating and test waters
[28/10/2025, 14:01:09] Andie: Theres plenty to test the sooner the better monetisation strategy are always a bit long and cold start
[28/10/2025, 16:59:01] ~ YesImprettydrey😘: I think for now doing it for free is okay and see how it goes
[28/10/2025, 18:06:38] Hope: Just had a meeting with Malcom, 

He’s mainly just focused in getting people of the minority backgrounds to be better represented in trustee-ship so he can either help me to be a  trustee in a bigger neurodiversity charity or help us get more neurodiverse/ Caucasian/ Asian trustees on the board
[28/10/2025, 22:54:58] ~ Sam: Hi Lynn,

I listened to the audio Oprah shared for the website we’re currently designing. Could you please help me find a suitable soundtrack that we can use for the IVF website? Like 3 soundtrack

https://www.linkedin.com/in/neurodiversity-iveta?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app
[29/10/2025, 15:50:31] Hope: Is everyone free at 7pm uk time?
[29/10/2025, 16:09:44] Hope: Hi @⁨~Lynn sarue⁩ the logos on some platforms still have a black background. 

We had a meeting discussing this and nothing has changed yet?
[29/10/2025, 16:11:48] Hope: Please confirm your working hours cause your responses have been sporadic too? 

I need to know when you are working and therefore if I should expect a response or not. @⁨~Lynn sarue⁩ 

The weekly check-ins have also stopped, why is that?
[29/10/2025, 16:36:40] ~ Lynn sarue: That’s fine
[29/10/2025, 16:38:30] ~ Lynn sarue: On the go fund me link we are using the black logo is refusing to change it’s saying the number issue, I wanted to change that first for uniformity so that first because you highlighted that all platforms should have the same logo and I communicated that last time we spoke
[29/10/2025, 16:42:07] ~ Lynn sarue: On WhatsApp yes I have always highlighted that I work more on emails, I move away from WhatsApp to avoid distractions my work hours are still the same 8am to 1pm. Zim time. I respond when I get a chance via WhatsApp out of respect because most of you send updates in the evening. And I respond when I am addressed, when I do not respond to something is because I don’t have an opinion on it. If an instruction is sent I attend  to it and send information via email and cc both of you.
[29/10/2025, 16:45:34] ~ Lynn sarue: I sent a weekly check in with all updated information that you both never responded to. And when I saw you didn’t respond I even sent reminders Monday morning when on meetings. 

I will check if it was a delivery issue but all highlights said sent. If not will resend in the morning. 

I even highlighted to you last week  that I am focusing on the grant applications I saw on linked in and the other donation information I saw being used in Zimbabwe that is my key focus.  

If there is any information you are missing kindly let me know so that I send and highlight.
[29/10/2025, 16:53:46] ~ Lynn sarue: The logos on all platforms except go fund me have the white logo
[29/10/2025, 17:50:03] Hope: Hi Lynn, 


I’ve just see your email. 

I will respond.

Thanks for changing the gmail ivf logo as well

I’ve messaged the second one

‎[01/11/2025, 08:12:19] Hope: ‎image omitted
[01/11/2025, 08:12:19] Hope: Morning guys! What do we think?
[01/11/2025, 08:15:05] ~ YesImprettydrey😘: This is nice👍
[01/11/2025, 08:15:26] ~ YesImprettydrey😘: Morning
[01/11/2025, 09:50:50] Andie: Sorry I needed a chance to think and to recover from the chaotic nature of my weeks and thought life.
[01/11/2025, 09:50:53] Andie: Morning
[01/11/2025, 09:51:46] Andie: This is truly awesome Oppy! I’d only just encourage the designer to test all his font choices and particularly the small stuff written at the bottom as an Accessibility friendly quest
[01/11/2025, 09:53:38] Andie: Cause nowadays hyper legibility is not an after-thought its like a must by design. That comes from my UI/UX design principles that dictate that the concept of “beauty is in the eyes of a beholder” it holds even more true if you tap into the universality of agreed upon BEAUTIFUL designs choice. Now im gonna go a bit nerdy here😂😂
[01/11/2025, 09:54:30] Andie: If you keep an eye on the symmetrical synergy of all his designs work 10/10 no doubt about it together with the colour grading one can call it.
[01/11/2025, 09:58:09] Andie: But there needs may even for the future need to be hyper legibility in the sense that its not IMPOSSIBLE as is to read say the line of the address but I also should especially as one with normal sight and not impediments be squeezing a bit my focal capacity to focus and understand all the letters showing up together with the for more info. The information hierarchy font family/decision has to be able to drive the person attention to not dismiss critical details and when the font is mmmh a bit tight/not really breathing, well it can be assumed generally that it wont serve all the neurodivergent brains let alone neurotypical. 

Again, what I am not saying that is BAD what I am saying that it can be costly at scale, cost someone missing important information cause they are struggling with legibility.
[01/11/2025, 09:58:25] Andie: I hope my English make sense😂😂
[01/11/2025, 09:59:01] Andie: Looking up! Just be technically challenged by a few technical implementations.
[01/11/2025, 09:59:27] Andie: Im so sorry @⁨~Lynn sarue⁩ did the inbox resolve correctly? I was supposed to revisit that, got swamped with some things.
[01/11/2025, 10:02:00] Andie: https://youtu.be/wjE5eHLICzc?si=qlcL64DaA8mdzhGd

This is the level work I think about from the ground up, the up is your poster the ground is the Font Family and Typography across all your material. Its not a casual but very intentional decision and also STATEMENT you make, cause at scale it will be noticeable between us most likely dismissed as non important but for a charity that want to be concerned of peoples neurodiversity it’s actually has to be pondered about. In my most humble opinion🙏
[01/11/2025, 10:23:48] ~ Lynn sarue: Hi no it is not it’s still sending the same alerts.
[01/11/2025, 10:33:07] Andie: Thanks Lynn! Will review this

I’m Opprah Manyika, Founder of the Irene Vera Foundation — a UK-registered charity working to advance education among young people in both Zimbabwe and the UK, especially those who are:
• socially or economically disadvantaged
• neurodivergent (including ADHD, autism, or dyslexia)
• living with physical disabilities

We do this by providing resources, support, and opportunities, promoting inclusive learning environments, and offering educational grants and materials to those in need.

As part of our awareness work, we’ve commissioned a free webinar in partnership with Psymplicity Healthcare, led by Dr Beider (CEO & Consultant Adult Psychiatrist):
🧠 “Understanding ADHD: Clinical Insights and Management Tips.”

This 45-minute session will share practical advice and genuine insights for anyone affected by ADHD — whether diagnosed, curious, or supporting someone who is.

📅 Date: 4 December 2025
💙 Hosted by: Irene Vera Foundation × Psymplicity Healthcare

[08/05/2024, 21:58:02] Andie: The .usdz file format is used for Augmented Reality (AR) purposes, primarily on Apple devices. It stands for Universal Scene Description. Blender doesn't natively support exporting to .usdz, but you can use plugins or converters to achieve this functionality.
[08/05/2024, 22:06:33] Andie: AR, or Augmented Reality, overlays digital content onto the real world through devices like smartphones or AR glasses, enhancing the user's perception of reality. It integrates digital information, such as images, videos, or 3D models, into the user's environment in real-time.

WebAR, on the other hand, refers to Augmented Reality experiences that are accessible through web browsers without the need for downloading dedicated apps. It allows users to access AR content directly from a web page, making AR more accessible and easier to experience without additional installations.

[21/05/2024, 07:21:31] Youmna (BYP): Why?
[21/05/2024, 07:21:38] Andie: I am well thanks! I have been at their Angel investment event and there seemed to be a lot of talk in investing into female founder businesses
[21/05/2024, 07:21:56] Andie: and ofcos the entire premise of the night is the fact that most get access to 2% of the capital
[21/05/2024, 07:22:24] Andie: don't think you would have seen the movie, but you probably don't need to as it is a reflection of the conversation we had around the table
[21/05/2024, 07:23:03] Andie: okay so then I will just send you an email recapping the entire event and you let me know which introduction would be of good use to you? deal?

[21/05/2024, 07:27:19] Andie: thank you
[21/05/2024, 07:34:26] Andie: yeah especially with certain product they are extremely conservative and risk advers

[21/05/2024, 07:34:48] Andie: I heard it all in the screen but also from the panel too
[21/05/2024, 07:37:03] Andie: may I know who this founder you connected her to is? we are trying to build a Welsh founders collective so that they can be of support and source of strength to each other
[21/05/2024, 07:37:12] Andie: as too many move on their own
[21/05/2024, 07:54:19] Andie: I have a lot of other documents from Lloyds Bank, which wanted me to bring on board Black entrepreneurs. I can introduce you to a Senior Manager there who is invested in women's initiatives. She definitely has the power to pull some strings anywhere in the UK. And if not her then someone that she will know, but she is extremely lovely and me introducing her and passing your deck will absolutely set her ablaze
[21/05/2024, 07:54:54] Andie: I will go ahead and do all this Youmna, then we can touch base again and you let me know what has helped so we can do more of what else
[21/05/2024, 07:55:08] Andie: I didnt answer that too well!
[21/05/2024, 07:56:05] Andie: I am glad to announce that I have officially finished this University chapter, and currently in talk to Agnes myself to validate a bit more my business ideas as I continue teaching myself and read leaders ideas to inform my strategy

[21/05/2024, 08:43:09] Youmna (BYP): Ameeeeen brother
[21/05/2024, 08:50:16] Andie: so I used to work on a music tech startup, but now I'm focusing on helping first-generation university students through a social enterprise called FirstGens UK (https://www.firstgens.co.uk/). We're always looking for ways to make education better, and this platform could be a big part of that. I currently sit on the board of advisories.
[21/05/2024, 08:50:36] Andie: I want to make learning super fun and easy for teachers and students.
[21/05/2024, 08:50:49] Andie: Teachers can get help planning lessons and support during class, while students get personalised learning help.
[21/05/2024, 08:51:05] Andie: The platform will use something called large language models (LLMs) to make all this happen. It's important to make sure it meets educational standards and keeps everyone's information safe.

[21/05/2024, 08:55:31] Andie: My vision is to create an LLM-powered education platform
[21/05/2024, 08:55:57] Andie: it's based on the book that just came out that explains how they or we go it here, by the founder of KhanAcademy, Sal Khan
[21/05/2024, 08:56:45] Andie: currently some teachers in the UK came together and are doing to streamline the hard parts of being a teacher but I think is too costly
‎[21/05/2024, 08:58:04] Andie: ‎image omitted
[21/05/2024, 08:58:37] Andie: KhanAcademy is a non-profit and is now giving access during is piloting in America for only $4
[21/05/2024, 09:01:50] Youmna (BYP): That is a great idea
[21/05/2024, 09:02:21] Youmna (BYP): I will keep my ears in case open

[21/05/2024, 09:02:40] Youmna (BYP): This is definitely something they will love
[21/05/2024, 09:02:53] Andie: it stems from interacting with Welsh kids and see the depravity
[21/05/2024, 09:03:17] Andie: you mean any one, or there is one particular in mind?
[21/05/2024, 09:03:31] Andie: cause it didn't appear quite clear to agnes yet so still refining my pitch
[21/05/2024, 09:03:49] Youmna (BYP): Keep a look on unlocking potential

[21/05/2024, 09:05:47] Andie: I have no rush whatsoever I prolly wont be first in the market
[21/05/2024, 09:05:59] Andie: But I do have cost effective ways to do it as its very expensive tech
[21/05/2024, 09:06:20] Andie: so its finding true specialists to steer my thinking I need
[21/05/2024, 09:06:28] Andie: so this is hugely appreciated thanks

[21/05/2024, 10:38:48] Andie: Also Youmna I think this will really help you keep track of all your contact and networks, especially if you're then able to connect it to a Client Relationship Management system or CRM

[21/05/2024, 10:41:09] Andie: the other person taps their phone and they can fill out their details and a note to transfer to you and this can technically be moved across whatever system you use so potentially a CRM

[21/05/2024, 10:47:25] Andie: if you read into it and like it
[21/05/2024, 11:02:27] Andie: https://ovolu.com/p/jay
[21/05/2024, 11:16:02] Andie: *This is how it would work for you Youmna*

The contactless NFC business cards like Evrycard [3] could be a useful tool for you to streamline sharing your contact details and networking more efficiently. By simply tapping the NFC card on someone's smartphone, you can instantly transfer your information like email, phone number, social media links, and more directly to their contacts.

This eliminates the hassle of manually entering details or losing traditional paper business cards. The Evrycard website highlights how these digital cards allow you to "Share. Anything. Anywhere." and keep important connections from getting lost. [3]

To maximize the utility of this system, you could integrate it with a free Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform like HubSpot's CRM [1]. This would allow you to centrally manage all the new contacts you collect through the NFC cards, track interactions, and nurture those relationships more effectively.

HubSpot's CRM offers tools for your whole team to organize business relationships, manage the sales pipeline, respond to customer support issues, send bulk personalized emails, and gain insights through reporting and analytics - all for free with unlimited contacts. [1] Combining the contactless NFC cards with a capable free CRM could significantly enhance your networking capabilities and contact management workflow.

[06/06/2024, 11:28:31] Andie: this is the rest of the playlist in case there is other things there that you may want to add for better understanding of the overall concept, these are century hold practice that have only been renamed and being repopularised. There is nothing new under the sun.

[21/06/2024, 12:04:46] Andie: I highly recommend Perplexity.AI especially the pro if you ever needed to go indepth in research and wanted to do that effectively and productively
[21/06/2024, 12:07:03] Andie: Like I showed you briefly yesterday, for those times when you can't remember specific details from past research, you can use a query like: "What is that thing that makes a room brighten up if you install it on a wall?" and the search engine will respond with: "a light bulb... etc." ‎<This message was edited>

[21/06/2024, 21:37:34] Andie: btw this is where my idea culmination came from sis
[21/06/2024, 21:37:48] Andie: You could go back 2,300 years to Alexander the Great. His tutor was Aristotle. And that was an exceptionally good tutor. But through most of human history, if you were privileged enough to get an education, you usually got something like that, a tutor, or sometimes even an army of tutors that would work with you. If you needed to speed up, they'd speed up. If you needed to slow down, they'd slow down."
[21/06/2024, 21:38:10] Andie: The argument is that this type of one-on-one, personalized tutoring represents the ideal learning experience. He then explains how modern technology, including artificial intelligence, can help approximate this level of personalized education for a much broader audience: ‎<This message was edited>
[21/06/2024, 21:38:44] Andie: "The opportunity with technology has been, we have computers, we have the internet. We have on-demand video, and now we have artificial intelligence. There are now ways to increasingly approximate the type of one-on-one personalized experience that the best educations have always been throughout history, but to do it at scale.

[04/07/2024, 13:13:48] Youmna (BYP): What do you think?
[04/07/2024, 13:25:26] Andie: Yeah I think its pretty good Youmna!
[04/07/2024, 13:25:49] Andie: Especially for a start cause the housing market has been so difficult these days
[04/07/2024, 13:26:07] Andie: Personally it does feel quite restrictive cause u basically dont have a separate lounge
[04/07/2024, 13:26:19] Andie: But the kitchen is separated enough from the living room
[04/07/2024, 13:26:56] Andie: Only problem that i was expecting the place to extend to a bedroom of some kind but no it was literally just the one room and then kitchen immediately after and next to it a bathroom ‎<This message was edited>
[04/07/2024, 13:28:09] Youmna (BYP): ‎Missed voice call, ‎Tap to call back
[04/07/2024, 13:28:19] Andie: It doesnt take away from the great location, proximity to the city, walkable distance, 15-20min max ur in town and the road although busy, as one of the main road by grangetown, is separated by the flats
[04/07/2024, 13:28:24] Andie: ‎Voice call, ‎6 min

[04/07/2024, 14:47:46] Andie: it just bothers me a little that there wasnt a separate bedroom
[04/07/2024, 14:48:08] Andie: but you dont get immediately all you want, sometimes
[04/07/2024, 15:08:39] Youmna (BYP): It is actually the case at my brother's

[30/07/2024, 20:40:28] Andie: Hello sis! I hope you are handling the whole Airbnb situation well, and its going smoother
[30/07/2024, 20:40:38] Andie: you've been on my mind a lot so sent you an email
[30/07/2024, 20:41:23] Andie: Given your scientific background and the current trends in Generative AI, there's potential for you to easily be among the first to integrate AI technologies into hair care products, further solidifying your first-mover status. All in the email as to how, any more questions I have an entire game plan for you if ever interested.
[30/07/2024, 20:42:22] Youmna (BYP): In sha Allah, I will find a  solution with the Airbnb.
[30/07/2024, 20:42:36] Youmna (BYP): What do you have in mind regarding AI and hair?
[30/07/2024, 20:43:42] Andie: right, hopefully I can distill it better but quite simply
[30/07/2024, 20:43:47] Andie: recognising the transformative potential of AI in general in various industries, including its ability to optimize complex tasks and drive innovation. ‎<This message was edited>
[30/07/2024, 20:44:28] Andie: I agree with the thought leaders and see AI as a new "operating system" for future technological advancements.
[30/07/2024, 20:45:03] Andie: I cited Nvidia as a prime example of how AI can be leveraged to achieve significant advancements in technology, e.g. in chip design.
[30/07/2024, 20:45:30] Andie: Nvidia's use of generative AI to streamline and optimise chip design processes serves as an inspiration for applying similar principles to other fields.
[30/07/2024, 20:45:52] Andie: Specifically, I see potential in using AI to further optimise the design and functionality of the Nyfasi Deluxe Detangler.
‎[30/07/2024, 20:47:52] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[30/07/2024, 20:52:43] Andie: It's great that you shared this information. I wanted to encourage thinking outside the box regarding design optimisation. The goal is to improve the Nyfasi Deluxe Detangler by enhancing manufacturing processes, ergonomics, and exploring other innovative design areas
[30/07/2024, 20:55:08] Andie: You could use specialised a custom Large Language Model, similar to Nvidia's approach, to optimise the design of the Nyfasi Deluxe Detangler.

The developed custom Large Language conversational model/chatbot trained on hair care product design, materials science, and user experience data.

This LLM would incorporate knowledge from scientific papers, patent databases, user reviews, and manufacturing processes specific to hair care products.
Design Optimisation:

The LLM could generate multiple design variations of the detangler, considering factors like tooth spacing, handle ergonomics, and overall shape.

It could simulate how different designs interact with various hair types, textures, and lengths.

The model could suggest innovative features, such as adjustable tooth spacing or interchangeable combs for different hair types.

[27/08/2024, 11:05:42] Andie: And I definitely think its worth using a microfibre clothes ones used to clean glasses to clean ur lenses behind the phone as they seemed steamed if anything
[27/08/2024, 11:05:51] Andie: Some thoughts sis
[27/08/2024, 11:05:58] Andie: 💭
[27/08/2024, 11:15:01] Andie: And no worries for the young accountant, Ill let her know to stay on standby. Is there any chance we could share some space in your storage, she said she’d like to have some of her stuff next to mine, neither of us have to much but she drives so she can sort her stuff but we would go together and can also contribute to your costs
[27/08/2024, 11:29:33] Youmna (BYP): I have an oppo
[27/08/2024, 11:31:14] Andie: I remember that yes, model and year would help too, thx
[27/08/2024, 11:36:27] Youmna (BYP): Model cph2343
[27/08/2024, 11:36:44] Andie: thanks so much
[27/08/2024, 11:36:46] Andie: on it
[27/08/2024, 12:22:00] Andie: *Resolution and Aspect Ratio:* Set your camera to the highest resolution available to capture detailed images. Use the 4:3 aspect ratio for the best quality, as it utilizes the full sensor.
[27/08/2024, 12:22:20] Andie: *HDR Mode:* Enable HDR (High Dynamic Range) mode to capture more detail in both the shadows and highlights, especially in high-contrast scenes. ‎<This message was edited>
[27/08/2024, 12:22:42] Andie: *Grid Lines:* Turn on the grid lines in your camera settings to help compose your shots according to the rule of thirds, which can make your images more visually appealing
[27/08/2024, 12:23:06] Andie: *Clean the Lens:* Ensure the camera lens is clean before shooting. Dust or smudges can affect image clarity and quality
[27/08/2024, 12:23:23] Andie: *Focus and Exposure:* Tap on the subject on your screen to set the focus and adjust the exposure. This ensures that your subject is sharp and well-lit.
[27/08/2024, 12:27:14] Andie: Set the video resolution to 1080p at 30 frames per second (fps). This is the highest available setting on the OPPO Reno7 Z 5G and will provide clear and detailed video quality
[27/08/2024, 13:03:54] Youmna (BYP): What do you think of this quality?
[27/08/2024, 13:04:12] Andie: About to give it a watch already pains me that whatsapp can sometimes downgrade it
[27/08/2024, 13:04:22] Andie: So woukd suggest even just a shared link
[27/08/2024, 13:04:27] Andie: Sorry i know extra steps

[27/08/2024, 13:05:18] Youmna (BYP): Ohh
[27/08/2024, 13:05:45] Andie: Gosh Social media as it is will destroy its quality further, but what pains me is how it plays on whatsapp, its blurrs
[27/08/2024, 13:06:01] Youmna (BYP): Ohh no
[27/08/2024, 13:06:16] Youmna (BYP): You are right
[27/08/2024, 13:06:21] Youmna (BYP): It is blurred
[27/08/2024, 13:06:44] Andie: The blur should slighly happen if I zoom in either on the phone or IG
[27/08/2024, 13:06:54] Andie: But not from standard zoom if that make sense
‎[27/08/2024, 13:06:55] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[27/08/2024, 13:09:28] Andie: its just 720 noo that's bad

[27/08/2024, 13:11:16] Youmna (BYP): Ok
[27/08/2024, 13:11:30] Andie: there is still like grainy or grainess in the video and blur around
[27/08/2024, 13:11:39] Andie: I am suspecting WhatsApp is contributing
[27/08/2024, 13:11:55] Andie: so if u are able to share this way for me again: https://wetransfer.com/
[27/08/2024, 13:12:08] Andie: u basically just press upload no need to sign ini
‎[27/08/2024, 13:12:54] Andie: ‎image omitted
[27/08/2024, 13:14:01] Andie: just press okay, okay till u get to upload files button and then will let u select the video from ur galler and once uploaded give u a link for me. let me know if u find it easy enough. there is a short reel tutorial for it too, its the easiest way to keep file Quality Intact.
[27/08/2024, 13:14:34] Andie: this should be available under ur camera settings, also, since u said ur on 720p quality.
‎[27/08/2024, 13:16:57] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted

[27/08/2024, 13:17:28] Andie: checking quality of both my phones
[27/08/2024, 13:18:24] Andie: also on WhatsApp depending on which device is on so hoping ur phone too it should let you select to send it to me at the highest quality, its a button that u press called "HD", if that also is available to you as it should retain its original detail and all
[27/08/2024, 13:19:42] Andie: U have Telegram? there is no video compression there also.
[27/08/2024, 13:20:08] Andie: but there is definitely on WhatsApp so the true quality of it as you recorded it will not come through.
[27/08/2024, 13:20:17] Andie: hence this sis
[27/08/2024, 13:24:42] Andie: A lot better but definitely grainy and has blurry going around your figure all cause of the compression
[27/08/2024, 13:24:48] Andie: See if I save this now
‎[27/08/2024, 13:25:32] Andie: ‎image omitted

[27/08/2024, 22:32:04] Andie: let me take a look thanks!
[28/08/2024, 00:29:05] Andie: Thoroughly reviewed your video, with Nana actually, and we'd like to offer some comprehensive feedback to help elevate your presentation. Here's a detailed breakdown of our observations and suggestions:
[28/08/2024, 00:29:32] Andie: *Video quality and filming technique:*


The video appears to have been shot with a smartphone rather than a professional camera, it's quite telling.

There's noticeable shaking when zooming in on products, suggesting handheld filming.

Recommendation: Use a stabilizer or tripod for smoother shots, or film static shots and add zooming effects during editing. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/2024, 00:29:49] Andie: *Background and lighting:*

The background is very white, which may appear too stark or "raw."

Suggestion: Consider adding some color, possibly using colored lights to cast the brand's colors in the background for more visual interest. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/2024, 00:30:00] Andie: *Product presentation:*

The products appear too static and linearly arranged on the table.

Recommendation: Create more dynamic product shots by arranging them differently or showing them in use. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/2024, 00:30:31] Andie: *Content and storytelling:*

The video lacks context and a compelling story about the product and brand.

Suggestion: Include more background information, such as the development process, challenges faced, and why this product is unique in the saturated afro hair care market.
[28/08/2024, 00:30:44] Andie: *Target audience clarity:*

If the video is for a specific group (e.g., pre-sale customers), make this clear from the beginning.

Consider creating separate videos for different audience segments.
[28/08/2024, 00:31:05] Andie: *Personal branding:*

Emphasize Youmna's personal story and connection to the product more.

Show more of her personality and journey in developing the product.
[28/08/2024, 00:31:23] Andie: *Hair type representation:*

Consider showcasing the product on different hair types, particularly 4C hair, to demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness.
[28/08/2024, 00:31:39] Andie: *Overall production value:*

While the current video might be sufficient for a quick update to existing customers, consider higher production value for future marketing materials.
[28/08/2024, 00:32:44] Andie: *To enhance this:*

Create more dynamic product shots. Arrange them at different heights or angles to create visual interest.

Show the products being used. This could be on a model or even just your hands demonstrating application techniques.

Consider before-and-after shots to showcase the product's effectiveness.


*Content and Storytelling:*

Your video would benefit from more context and a compelling narrative about your product and brand. Viewers connect with stories, and this is your chance to really sell your unique position in the market. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/2024, 00:33:16] Andie: *Try incorporating:*

The development process of your product. What inspired you? What challenges did you face?

Your personal connection to the product. Why was it important for you to create this?

What makes your product unique in the saturated afro hair care market?

Customer testimonials or your own experiences with the product.
[28/08/2024, 00:33:30] Andie: *Target Audience Clarity:*

If this video is intended for a specific group, such as pre-sale customers, it's crucial to make this clear from the outset.
[28/08/2024, 00:33:52] Andie: *Consider:*

Stating clearly at the beginning who this video is for. For example: "To all my early supporters who pre-ordered..."

Creating separate videos for different audience segments. One for existing customers, one for potential new customers, etc.
[28/08/2024, 00:34:12] Andie: *Nana*: You are your brand's best ambassador. The video would benefit from emphasizing your personal story and connection to the product more prominently.
[28/08/2024, 00:34:33] Andie: *Too achieve this:*

Share more about your journey in developing the product.
Don't be afraid to show your personality. Your passion for your product will be contagious.
If you've overcome any personal challenges related to hair care, share these. It will help viewers relate to you. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/2024, 00:35:25] Andie: On more positive notes, your on-camera presence is excellent. You appear professional, engaging, and authentic in your light blue hijab and textured white top. Your direct gaze and open body language create a connection with the viewer.
[28/08/2024, 00:35:38] Andie: We believe implementing these suggestions will significantly enhance the impact and effectiveness of your product video. Remember, the goal is to not just inform, but to engage and excite your audience about your product.

[28/08/2024, 06:28:13] Andie: Morning Youmna! Oh I get, then, it will be absolutely fine no problem, I thought this was going on IG. Let me give you a better quality one.
[28/08/2024, 06:28:43] Andie: using what you made available for me yesterday:
‎[28/08/2024, 06:30:43] Andie: ‎image omitted
[28/08/2024, 06:31:49] Andie: Heeyyy whatever you did for this one, the quality its exceptional, if you are familiar with how to use Canva Pro for video editing rather than the one you currently use, then will be a lot more easier to retain its high quality format and make it adaptable for email
[28/08/2024, 06:32:25] Andie: if you want to stay using the current editor u use then let me sugges a better Export setting to that it doesn't lose it fine detail.
[28/08/2024, 06:33:17] Andie: I replay that 250mb file u sent me over wetransfer and is perfect, now extracting your voice from this Ultra HD one that you sent via link and then will send you it on its own here but also a video with it overlay on it.
[28/08/2024, 06:33:38] Andie: CapCut pro is also hugely recommended as video editor.
[28/08/2024, 06:36:54] Andie: this is how I do it, but I separate the audio from video to be able to do it
[28/08/2024, 06:36:57] Andie: https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-isolator
[28/08/2024, 06:37:06] Andie: its know as a Voice Isolator
[28/08/2024, 06:39:06] Andie: https://youtu.be/DZ0PidjQZVs?si=1R24eEbefcV2QOiZ
[28/08/2024, 06:39:34] Andie: not just background noise but also echoing and any other thing that detract from your voice being heard clearly.
[28/08/2024, 06:46:38] Youmna (BYP): I did it in inshoy
[28/08/2024, 06:46:46] Youmna (BYP): Inshot
‎[28/08/2024, 06:47:44] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[28/08/2024, 06:49:15] Andie: absolutely and u will just need to substitute this final one on the exisiting edit you did and remove the old one and then make sure that on inshot you save at aspect ratio 16:9 is a widescreen aspect ratio
[28/08/2024, 06:49:44] Andie: so we can get rid of these black horizontal borders that say inShot
[28/08/2024, 06:50:40] Youmna (BYP): https://we.tl/t-FWRHQ5rfF1

[28/08/2024, 06:50:51] Andie: thank you so much on it
[28/08/2024, 06:51:17] Andie: also downloading inshot on my iPhone to show u exact setting for proper exporting and retain quality
[28/08/2024, 06:52:14] Andie: this has already reduce quality cause u've done some editing on inshot, could I have the original footage ur happy with on it own then I will return that to you
[28/08/2024, 06:52:33] Andie: otherwise I will just be using this one, remember u sent it also with wetransfer link
[28/08/2024, 06:52:57] Andie: so can remove the audio from that and then send it to you over her with your voice isolated.
[28/08/2024, 06:53:04] Andie: hope that make sense
[28/08/2024, 06:54:51] Andie: getting the audio from this one and then sending that to you on its own but also within the video as well so you have both to work with
[28/08/2024, 06:55:13] Andie: like I said with this, having you already edited it the quality has been downgraded

[28/08/2024, 07:17:02] Andie: quality is actually good on this one, I mean video wise
[28/08/2024, 07:17:03] Andie: thanks
[28/08/2024, 07:18:03] Andie: also highly recommend this as also free powerful alternative to InShot down the line: https://www.vlognow.me/ outside of CapCut and CapCut pro, might be a slight learning curve

[28/08/2024, 08:58:22] Andie: https://byp.network/byp-team/andie-kobbie/
[28/08/2024, 09:23:09] Youmna (BYP): Are you getting paid to support founders?
[28/08/2024, 09:45:09] Andie: not quite
[28/08/2024, 09:45:16] Andie: BYP Network Chapter Lead Contract - Compensation Summary
[28/08/2024, 09:45:39] Andie: Overview

[28/08/2024, 09:49:34] Andie: I tried get employment with Luke, that introduced you, as they had a part time role as a Business Coach that I could mange in my own time, but they ghosted me and then I went on the website and saw that it was removed, so was like never mind.

[28/08/2024, 09:58:47] Andie: But they keep asking me if I have a client and whats my business and when I am planning to register
[28/08/2024, 10:04:26] Youmna (BYP): I see
[28/08/2024, 10:04:43] Andie: This was my pitch sis ‎<This message was edited>

[28/08/2024, 13:07:20] Andie: There it is

[28/08/2024, 13:07:50] Andie: Oh you need someone who does mostly Hair
[28/08/2024, 13:08:14] Youmna (BYP): They can do a mix but this lady is only focusing on wigs
[28/08/2024, 13:08:18] Andie: Then I can introduce you to this lady instead, many have moved their way into that cause of better profits but have background in it
[28/08/2024, 13:08:37] Andie: will double check with Nana cause she may not adverise it

I’m currently a bit short on funds due to some delays in payments and invoices, which is making it challenging for me to get out of the house much right now. However, I do have a DSLR camera, a Canon EOS 2000D, which I used for photography before I had to refocus on my final year of university studies this year.

Looking forward to working together!
[05/09/2024, 13:40:49] Andie: I’m available for the shoot on Saturday and would love to help out. I can also get the iPhones to you, so if we can arrange the meetup at Sharon’s studio, that would be great.
[05/09/2024, 13:42:55] Youmna (BYP): I feel you! We are in the same boat. That why I wasn't shy taking those pizza 🤣🤣🤣

[05/09/2024, 13:45:04] Andie: Dont forget ur access to the stertup studio to record content and the equipment there, I can help u with all of that setup, and u can access it around the clock cause it works by code they explained to me time ago ‎<This message was edited>
[05/09/2024, 13:45:48] Andie: I think its more getting you into the routine of knowing well your gear and then u can press play and have a quick way to also post, you will be amazing! You pick everything so fast, I teach so I know!
[05/09/2024, 13:58:51] Andie: Missed calls, because it was easier to discuss over the phone, relate to the fact that just as Mariam has been found to be an eligible tech business, so are you. 

This is due to the simple fact that you use a variety of technology to support your own product. Otherwise, you would need a traditional kiosk or pop-up shop. 

Therefore, you should easily qualify as a tech business if Mariam with BlackFlamigo does. 

As you may have heard Chris mention during the evening discussion. Your Shopify presence and utilisation to scale . ‎<This message was edited>

[06/09/2024, 07:52:33] Andie: *Why This is Possible:* ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 07:52:50] Andie: *Viral Potential*: TikTok’s algorithm promotes content based on engagement (likes, shares, comments). 

With the high view counts (e.g., 588.6K), it suggests that Nurse Nana’s content resonates well with her audience, leading to viral sharing and growth. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 07:53:10] Andie: *Educational Focus:* The pinned videos demonstrate that she shares important, actionable advice for nursing students, such as medical terminology and tips for passing exams. 

TikTok has become a platform where educational content thrives because people can learn quickly in a highly visual format. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 07:53:32] Andie: *Relatability and Authenticity:* Nurse Nana’s approach appears genuine and relatable, which resonates with the platform’s younger, diverse audience. 

Viewers prefer creators who present themselves authentically, especially in fields like nursing where personal experiences are valuable. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 07:53:56] Andie: *Short-form Video Popularity:* TikTok is highly effective for engaging viewers with short, digestible videos. 

Nurse Nana’s content (like nursing tips and education) fits well within TikTok’s format, making it easy to capture and maintain viewer attention. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 07:54:29] Andie: She most definitely understands the platform and YOU🫵 can leverage it too Youmna.

[06/09/2024, 08:21:14] Youmna (BYP): Morning Andy

[06/09/2024, 08:23:27] Andie: the only thing that didn't give her 100%, the content, while educational and relevant for nursing students, lacks engagement with broader trending topics that would attract wider public interest.
[06/09/2024, 08:24:16] Andie: Hope you rested well.

[06/09/2024, 08:52:39] Andie: this is really good sis, u just need one GOOD tutorial to get the proper full idea of how to leverage it potential.
[06/09/2024, 08:53:21] Andie: 1. *Lack of Audience Engagement*
*Signs of bad content*: Few likes, shares, comments, or interactions. Even if the information is solid, if it's not sparking conversation or interest, it's not resonating.
*Why it’s bad*: It fails to make an impact or encourage any action from the viewers, which is a primary goal for most content. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 08:53:28] Andie: 2. *Poor Relevance or Timing*
*Signs of bad content*: Posting irrelevant content that doesn’t fit current trends or the interests of the target audience.
*Why it’s bad*: Content that doesn’t align with what people are currently interested in, or feels outdated, will be ignored. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 08:53:34] Andie: 3. *Lack of Value or Usefulness*
*Signs of bad content*: Content that doesn’t teach, entertain, or provide value.
*Why it’s bad*: People engage with content that solves a problem, answers a question, or entertains them. If it's not offering value, people will simply scroll past it. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 08:53:43] Andie: 4. *Poor Presentation or Execution*
*Signs of bad content*: Low-quality visuals or sound, confusing messaging, or overly complicated explanations.
*Why it’s bad*: On platforms like TikTok, clean, sharp, and simple presentation is key. If it’s too hard to follow, users lose interest quickly. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 08:53:50] Andie: 5. *No Clear Call to Action (CTA)*
*Signs of bad content*: Content that doesn’t ask the audience to like, comment, share, or take any next step.
*Why it’s bad*: Without prompting action, the audience is passive. Content needs to drive engagement or conversions. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2024, 08:54:01] Andie: A "*bad*" post or content doesn't necessarily mean it's poorly made or unprofessional—it means it fails to connect with its intended audience or achieve its goals. ‎<This message was edited>

[06/09/2024, 09:21:21] Andie: OpusClip does more than just provide a virality score. It's an AI-powered tool that automatically creates short, viral-ready clips from longer videos.
[06/09/2024, 09:21:55] Andie: OpusClip analyzes your long-form video content and uses AI to:

Identify compelling moments and highlights

Extract and rearrange these segments into cohesive short clips

Automatically add captions, adjust aspect ratios, and enhance visuals

Provide a virality score for each generated clip
[06/09/2024, 09:22:28] Andie: You can then further customize these AI-generated clips using OpusClip's editing features before sharing them on social media platforms

[06/09/2024, 09:48:44] Andie: looks like not yet, but what's available is what the pic says, which is what we have been toying/playing with.
[06/09/2024, 09:51:36] Andie: *SUMMARY*: Visual search within videos: The AI can find specific visual moments or actions within long videos based on text descriptions, without relying on speech or captions. This allows you to quickly locate relevant clips without manually scrubbing through hours of footage.
[06/09/2024, 09:52:33] Andie: The visual search capability described in the video is a new beta feature called "Clip Anything" from Opus Clip
[06/09/2024, 09:53:14] Andie: Given that it's described as a beta feature, there is a waitlist AND limited access. The exact details of its current availability weren't specified in the video.
[06/09/2024, 09:53:35] Andie: Potentially sign up for updates or join a waitlist if it's not yet widely available.

[06/09/2024, 10:50:20] Andie: The image highlights a direct mail campaign, where personalized letters or packages are sent to recipients, which contrasts with the fast-paced, digital-driven social world.
[06/09/2024, 10:50:35] Andie: Direct mail, especially personalized packages, feels more intimate and thoughtful compared to emails or digital ads.

[10/09/2024, 12:45:50] Andie: Oh amazing thanks!
[10/09/2024, 14:44:39] Youmna (BYP): Hey Andy, what is the setting to see the text like paragraph instead of frame
‎[10/09/2024, 14:45:32] Youmna (BYP): ‎image omitted
[10/09/2024, 14:48:13] Andie: Lemme double check. Will get back to u
[10/09/2024, 14:53:21] Andie: Sis
[10/09/2024, 14:53:24] Andie: CapCut's caption editing interface typically displays captions as individual, numbered entries that correspond to specific timestamps in the video
[10/09/2024, 14:53:37] Andie: The auto-caption and manual caption features in CapCut are designed to work with these individual caption entries, allowing users to edit them one by one or in a batch edit mode
[10/09/2024, 14:54:03] Andie: While CapCut offers various options for customizing captions, including font styles, colors, and effects, there is no mention of a continuous paragraph
[10/09/2024, 14:55:19] Andie: For a workaround, you might consider copying the captions into a separate text editor to create a continuous view for proofreading.
‎[10/09/2024, 14:58:27] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[10/09/2024, 14:59:36] Andie: I think its because ur using the app whereas on the web version you might find a bit more room for that to work

[10/09/2024, 22:15:03] Andie: But the cuts are fantastic and it definitely gives off the vibes of a NyfasiLabs show

[10/09/2024, 22:19:45] Andie: Id say this can fit well within LinkedIn with a impactful caption too
[10/09/2024, 22:19:57] Youmna (BYP): We need to inspire ourself from this two istagram account.
[10/09/2024, 22:20:19] Andie: Can u resend me it without caption pls

[17/09/2024, 11:07:02] Youmna (BYP): Ok,.I will do so asap
[17/09/2024, 11:08:27] Andie: Thanks so much! Ive only had a few hurdles uploading your videos from IdeaFest, really sorry as the momentum is still hopefully there, gonna make sure to let you have them asap, was battling with the fact that they are in iPhone format which I thought u’d have trouble playing since its .MOV instead of .MP4 the most widely compatible
‎[17/09/2024, 14:43:42] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[17/09/2024, 14:51:38] Andie: Okay, pls give me till the end of this afternoon and will sort something out for you, cause Ive been having it on me, but I am here at the studio all day studying and exam prepping so can arrange for you to have it as soon as tomorrow potentially, as I leave it to back up all my stuff and then over to you, once its successfully done with that finally
[17/09/2024, 14:53:40] Youmna (BYP): Focus on the exam first
[17/09/2024, 14:54:23] Andie: Very amazing to see you have everything set and only this missing! I really look forward to let you have it
[17/09/2024, 14:55:39] Youmna (BYP): Thanks Andy for you support:)
[17/09/2024, 15:00:53] Andie: The pleasure is all mine sis🙏 good on your for keeping on keeping on! Whether is crawling, or anything else
[18/09/2024, 10:55:03] Andie: Morning, sis! I’ve been facing some challenges, but you can count on the iPhone being all prepped by today. I’ll be in the studio all day, but before leaving, I’ll make sure to store it safely somewhere so that even if I don’t see you for any reason, you can easily find it and pick it up. The only thing that might be missing is a charger, but I can grab one for you from a shop nearby for around £10. I’ll double-check, but they usually go for about that price.
[18/09/2024, 10:56:12] Andie: I hope you’re keeping well and apologies for all these technical delays especially with your videos from IdeaFest, its been a nightmare, cause although I have iPhone i work mostly with Windows so transferring between devices can be as awkward as youve seen last time we were in the studio together.
[18/09/2024, 10:57:57] Youmna (BYP): Bless you. That is ok.
[18/09/2024, 10:58:06] Youmna (BYP): How is the prep to the exam?
[18/09/2024, 11:00:00] Andie: not too bad actually, it's just a lot of material to familiarise well with, and virtual labs I have to complete to graduate from the programme as well.
[18/09/2024, 11:02:32] Youmna (BYP): Fantastic!
[18/09/2024, 11:02:52] Youmna (BYP): You really now your stuff!
[18/09/2024, 11:03:09] Andie: Do I have a choice?

[26/09/2024, 16:16:49] Andie: Nah but for real, I want to release them, but the pain of high quality recorded footage I would have never thought, definitely trying to look for work around but between hardware and software is tricky sis

[10/10/2024, 18:08:03] Andie: the kit looks like this

[10/10/2024, 18:10:35] Andie: usually these one will cost more, due to being a so called CLASS 10 which you see marked on the pic with '10' and a semic circle going around it
[10/10/2024, 18:10:54] Andie: it simply means that it has high speed in reading and writing on the memory chip
[10/10/2024, 18:11:00] Andie: here's a chart to understand the differences
‎[10/10/2024, 18:13:08] Andie: ‎image omitted
[10/10/2024, 18:28:28] Youmna (BYP): I will go with this one :)
[10/10/2024, 18:28:57] Andie: Great! I suppose u’d prefer amazon in such case then

[10/10/2024, 18:31:30] Andie: Alright Argos it is, its just a matter of shopping preferences so be it
[10/10/2024, 18:31:42] Andie: Btw the camera supports for card up to 128gb
[10/10/2024, 18:31:44] Andie: So like this
[10/10/2024, 18:32:05] Andie: https://amzn.eu/d/1IDileB
[10/10/2024, 18:33:40] Andie: Even within the same class (e.g., Class 10), the speed can vary significantly between cards. For instance, this card from Amazon offers a read speed of up to 205MB per second. This means that when downloading files to a PC and using a card reader (such as the one built into most laptops), you can expect to transfer 1GB of data at a rate of 205MB per second, assuming optimal conditions. ‎<This message was edited>

‎[14/10/2024, 17:51:47] Andie: ‎image omitted
[14/10/2024, 17:52:02] Andie: This is all of my stuff which was not worth keeping in a storage
[14/10/2024, 17:52:15] Andie: Hence me reshuffling it and downsizing dramatically
[14/10/2024, 17:52:32] Andie: Then the suit case I have with me are all clothes
[14/10/2024, 17:52:44] Andie: then here’s ur stuff with on top Sharons
‎[14/10/2024, 17:53:10] Andie: ‎image omitted
[14/10/2024, 17:53:56] Andie: I had to leave the camera by there but these all valuables if u have chance to get them over to ur place Id be very glad to contribute
[14/10/2024, 17:54:02] Andie: Especially the camera
[14/10/2024, 17:54:14] Andie: Cause theres people coming in and out of the studio and im not always sure who
[14/10/2024, 18:29:30] Youmna (BYP): OK, I will aim to get it on Wenesday. I will ask Amelia when I can go pick it
[14/10/2024, 18:37:04] Andie: Sure no worries! It just the way the studio owners are acting with Sharon that makes me concerned
[14/10/2024, 18:38:10] Youmna (BYP): Really
[14/10/2024, 18:38:14] Youmna (BYP): What do you mean
[14/10/2024, 18:38:22] Youmna (BYP): She seemed cool
[14/10/2024, 18:38:39] Andie: I mean that they didnt put as much pressure to the people next door as Sharon felt
[14/10/2024, 18:39:05] Andie: Thats why we spent such a long time there yesterday and Sharon kept complaining that she couldn’t understand why next to still had everything up
[14/10/2024, 18:39:32] Andie: When they were already kind of nagging of when when is was gonna leave the keys and be gone
[14/10/2024, 18:40:02] Andie: I met some guys taking meter readings today of the studio, which tells me that there’s some maintenance check going already or whatever
[14/10/2024, 18:40:35] Andie: Sharon told me she needed to be out by end of the month and then now it’s been pretty much 2nd week of Oct.
[14/10/2024, 18:42:57] Youmna (BYP): Are you speaking about the new studio or the old studio?
[14/10/2024, 18:43:20] Youmna (BYP): Did you guys finish yesterday?
[14/10/2024, 18:45:20] Andie: There’s an extra bag that didn’t appear in the picture next to the monitor box, which contains some bits and bolts. I tried to squeeze it inside the colorful bag but had a bit of a hard time. The bag with the blue handles is super light, the suitcase is probably between 15 to 25 kg, and the monitor weighs less than 3 kg. The magnetic whiteboard to the left of the blue-handled bag is quite heavy—around 6 kg—and can be used with the right marker pens if you’d like to use it for visualisation or diagrams. Otherwise, I’ll need to add it to the delivery.
[14/10/2024, 18:45:26] Andie: Old studio pls
[14/10/2024, 18:45:31] Andie: Yes we did
‎[14/10/2024, 18:45:45] Andie: ‎image omitted
[14/10/2024, 18:46:05] Andie: All was left is the bench and some bins at the back I couldn’t take downstairs
[14/10/2024, 18:52:18] Youmna (BYP): So it is urgent. I will call Sharon to ask if she need help on wenesday
[14/10/2024, 18:55:08] Andie: Yeah pls do check with her, personally for me the only urgent things would be that things are not kept in the space for too long so that Sharon doesn’t get a bad look or anything cause she really pushed it till late last night and it was crazy enough. I dont want to definitely add pressure to anyone so whatever is possible
[14/10/2024, 18:55:38] Andie: Thanks to Amira, the lady that bakes, we were able to move across to the other studio u mention a lot
[14/10/2024, 18:55:47] Youmna (BYP): Ok I will give her a call later
[14/10/2024, 18:55:52] Andie: and she also given has a reliable man and a van
[14/10/2024, 18:56:06] Youmna (BYP): Ok
[14/10/2024, 18:56:10] Andie: Yeah she only slept 3yrs so might be bit a bit of a struggle at the moment
[14/10/2024, 18:56:25] Andie: Neighbours started doing works and woke her up
[14/10/2024, 18:57:24] Andie: so she cancelled work, stayed home, and unfortunately also got told, and I do have to say cause I dont entirely know her mood that she needs to find a new accommodation by before February, cause landlady apparently wants to sell the house ‎<This message was edited>

It only takes 2 hours in the centre of Cardiff and in exchange, the participants will receive a free detangler in December.

Can you share this with friends and family who have curly or afro-textured hair?

[16/10/2024, 14:16:37] Andie: And was saying that she is not seeing enough tool demonstration and she didnt exactly understand what make much of a difference of her applying the product cause she does feel she evenly distributes it compres to the hair comb doing it

[04/11/2024, 21:13:51] Andie: but the unfortunate evil for us is that we have to learn hard coding cause u still need to know how to fix the coding side of these templates and that’s valued more. I can then move onto this high level developmentally
[04/11/2024, 21:13:57] Andie: Drag and drop and no code solutiones
[04/11/2024, 21:23:21] Youmna (BYP): I see

[05/11/2024, 12:29:58] Andie: coming from her, she said you should definitely add Klarna and ClearPay as paying option for people who wants to buy now and pay later cause she said lots have been opting for that if available in your configurations

[06/11/2024, 21:58:26] Andie: Hi Youmna! Is there any chance I could get my partner to test ur Deluxe detangler, she is having a very hard time with it but she does create content so could be a future potential collab with her as well. We were just talking today precisely about dentangling even with leave in conditioner she just having such hard time and really want to see if what she calls her “hars” and “untameable hair” can be finally tamed
[06/11/2024, 21:58:49] Andie: Hope you’re well sis and that not more technical issues are settling back plans

[06/11/2024, 22:16:38] Andie: Man imagine what this comb could do for her and literally solve that heartache
[06/11/2024, 22:17:12] Andie: so to speak, but its so interesting that the very pain point is that pain associated with taking care of your own self and hair to feel taken care of
[06/11/2024, 22:18:32] Youmna (BYP): She will be a great case study.
[06/11/2024, 22:18:47] Youmna (BYP): Sorry to hear that she is struggling si much

[04/12/2024, 21:49:31] Andie: this is exactly what I meant sis
[04/12/2024, 21:49:37] Andie: imagine this 😂😂
[04/12/2024, 21:50:07] Andie: sorry don't imagine, it is actually possible and with funding for R&D say from CEMET this could be prototyped

[04/12/2024, 21:54:05] Andie: shame that it was just conceptual at the time, but definitely with the right development could be achieved.

[05/12/2024, 04:47:24] Youmna (BYP): I will have a look and see if it appropriate for me at this time
[05/12/2024, 10:07:58] Andie: Yeah whenever it will most appropriate for you to persue. Can definitely be shelved till then.
[08/12/2024, 06:35:35] Andie: Morning sis! Unfortunately due to the adverse whether conditions they’re asking me to re-schedule this order again🥲 gosh it had to be the days I was actually able to finalise this, cant believe how much is dragging
[08/12/2024, 06:35:58] Andie: Could you kindly give me another availability within morning/afternoon for upcoming week pls
[08/12/2024, 06:36:20] Andie: Would appreciate it, and I am still sorry for clogging up your space

[08/12/2024, 21:25:15] Youmna (BYP): 🤣🤣 welcome to the club
[08/12/2024, 21:25:41] Andie: 😂😂😂

[08/12/2024, 21:30:09] Andie: oh okay perfect I'll have a look at the rescheduler
[08/12/2024, 21:30:12] Andie: thank you

[08/12/2024, 21:30:39] Andie: this should be way better quality wise
[08/12/2024, 21:30:46] Andie: enjoy
[08/12/2024, 21:31:32] Andie: im coding in any possible fun ways these days to add stuff to might online portfolio to show that I am busy😂 so here's me giving myself little projects.
[08/12/2024, 21:32:11] Andie: and documenting my learnings publicly on LinkedIn perhaps etc.
‎[08/12/2024, 21:34:45] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[08/12/2024, 21:35:35] Andie: it really would sis, if I can rendering you a better quality version with 3 different angles then u will be able to judge that for yourself.
[08/12/2024, 21:36:33] Andie: the video model of it will after downloading it only need background removal so its white and u can essentially also turn it into an interactive object on the page for people to zoom in really closely and also check out.
[08/12/2024, 21:36:47] Andie: excellent idea
[08/12/2024, 21:37:08] Youmna (BYP): Cool

[08/12/2024, 21:39:07] Andie: I really would need a very High Quality JPG or PNG or whatever incredibly crips quality you have, that would capture it perfectly, this lower res pic I am loading are producing the poor quality.
[08/12/2024, 21:39:15] Andie: but it does it in literally 3min

[08/12/2024, 21:45:14] Andie: Oh fantastic i think it will come out so much better from the imagine i get from the email thank u
‎[08/12/2024, 21:45:58] Andie: ‎video omitted
[08/12/2024, 21:46:22] Andie: its still this version so we are still at v1 and it looks like that u see in that very last video.
‎[08/12/2024, 21:49:02] Andie: ‎video omitted
[08/12/2024, 21:49:02] Andie: thanks to the technology that Microsoft has progressed and made open source and available to tech enthusiast like myself, voila!
[08/12/2024, 21:49:36] Andie: we need to teach new generous this stuff, so they are ahead of the curve and can use it in their own project even a powerpoint presentation will earn anyone higher grades with such visuals
[08/12/2024, 21:49:51] Andie: better quality
[08/12/2024, 21:52:23] Andie: just the video quality I meant could have been better, but it is how they developed this rendering platform exportation option so this is actually the video quality, potentially improvable with a very high crystal clear definition image even higher than the one u sent cause those are like 3D creating, here I am looking for a JPG file that is like professional camera shot at like 2k or 4k type of quality and u will see the crazy 3D sample that would come out
[08/12/2024, 21:52:28] Andie: will show u an example of that
[08/12/2024, 22:32:04] Andie: ‎You deleted this message.
[08/12/2024, 22:32:48] Andie: there it is sis, so will need to just get a very big JPG that is 5mb or 3mb or 10mb which suggests that it has a lot of detail and therefore will be high res and suitable for this knd of 3D rendering

[08/12/2024, 22:52:07] Andie: that's the problem that we are exactly trying to solve the fact that is a cost you can explore right now
[08/12/2024, 22:52:11] Andie: yeah I see what you mean
[08/12/2024, 22:55:02] Andie: yeah it would be exceptional, and it sounds like motion graphics, and this 3D model is only the beginning of it.
[08/12/2024, 23:05:09] Andie: this is soooo good Youmna wow!

[08/12/2024, 23:05:17] Andie: I am mindblown
[08/12/2024, 23:07:44] Andie: and you are indeed right about the actual 3D model data that is already available and could be used more effectively.
[08/12/2024, 23:08:38] Andie: its just a matter of getting the right format exportation from the CAD software
[08/12/2024, 23:16:09] Andie: Use the original 3D model data directly, if possible, rather than trying to recreate 3D from 2D renderings. Work with your engineer to see if the 3D model can be exported in a web-friendly format that maintains the detail you need.
[08/12/2024, 23:27:57] Andie: For now also you can supplement the main product visuals with close-up photos highlighting key details like the comb teeth. Good static photos, perhaps with some annotation, can communicate a lot if the 3D/animated visuals aren't perfect.
[08/12/2024, 23:28:39] Andie: and was thinking that you could Invest time in crafting excellent product descriptions, specs, FAQs, etc. to convey functionality. While visuals are impactful, great web copy goes a long way too and requires mostly time rather than money.
[08/12/2024, 23:28:58] Andie: Plan to enhance the visuals over time as budget allows. Get the core product info on the site ASAP even if not ideal, then gradually improve the media as you're able. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
[08/12/2024, 23:33:16] Andie: but this could really do it, this demo provides a quick and accessible way to start taking advantage of AI-generated 3D content.
[08/12/2024, 23:36:29] Andie: but any ways this is the top quality you can expect: https://trellis3d.github.io/
[09/12/2024, 00:35:13] Andie: this is literally the quality that I am looking for from you

[11/12/2024, 12:44:46] Andie: Hi Youmna! Sorry been keeping on messing up this order, im dealing with the courier explaining to me how I need to prepare the collection of this parcel, and the protocol to follow, will update you better in a minute but just know that they attempted it today but they said there was something wrong with the way I set this up beside them delaying due to unforeseen circumstances

[22/12/2024, 16:38:29] Andie: Hi Youmna,

I hope you’re well. Apologies for the delay—it’s been a bit of a mess after the storm. After discussing how to rearrange things, they offered me a refund, which I accepted. I’m now patiently waiting for that to be resolved.

Once that’s sorted, I think I’ll approach it one parcel at a time, as I’m finding it a bit too complicated with all their packaging requirements. This was with DPD, and it wasn’t as straightforward as I initially thought. Since they don’t handle parceling themselves, they require items to be securely packaged, such as with bubble wrap.

I’ll figure it out with you further when the time comes. ‎<This message was edited>

[13/02/2025, 13:27:06] Andie: you access my deep search of you through this link should be able to access those 117 READ sources, and be able to track done any relevant opportunities in your own time, but to reduce the landscape for you.
[13/02/2025, 14:34:09] Youmna (BYP): Andy , how much would you charge to build me a one page website?
[13/02/2025, 14:35:39] Youmna (BYP): I want to offer three services 

Book me to speak 
Workshop on self awareness 
Workshops on the mistake to avoid when commercialising an technology
[13/02/2025, 14:36:10] Youmna (BYP): This is a for institutions
[13/02/2025, 14:37:43] Youmna (BYP): Then I will have for individuals

One hour Book me to speak about your idea

Register interest for self awareness workshops held every three months
[13/02/2025, 14:39:03] Youmna (BYP): My mind is starting to see how this could work.
[13/02/2025, 14:40:59] Andie: I think, a week would be a reasonable timeline for a prototype of this, but I can easily spin sth up for you via caard.co and get you going until the final product is ready as you probably may want things place and rearranged a certain way, to keep your cost low I could integrate that with ur exisiting shopify tier if u are paying for that so you consolidate your costing.
‎[13/02/2025, 14:42:26] Andie: ‎image omitted
[13/02/2025, 14:43:27] Andie: I complete a deliverable, you confirm you're happy and payment is agreed and arranged but will break this down to you so you can approve on the way I quote the different work milestone involved.
[13/02/2025, 14:44:23] Andie: sounds good to me you can take the creative direction, Ill make sure it fits ur branding and everything you have already build, if you have a branding portfolio I will just work from that to make my life easier with fonts and colouring and styling
[13/02/2025, 14:44:36] Andie: I am glad, I was hoping so
[13/02/2025, 14:45:10] Andie: hence the breakdown of the areas I think you fit in like a glove, especially cause there is international women's day coming up
[13/02/2025, 14:46:11] Andie: Generally, freelance web designers in the UK charge between £20 and £100 per hour
[13/02/2025, 14:46:45] Andie: Hourly rates for web development services in the UK can vary significantly based on experience, location, the complexity of the project, and the specific services offered
[13/02/2025, 14:47:30] Andie: so I landed on that £15 mark cause its landing page and payment integration along with leveraging some existing platform
[13/02/2025, 14:56:55] Andie: Will draft you the invoice but will get to work for your quick prototype so you can get going🙏
[13/02/2025, 15:01:37] Youmna (BYP): ‎Voice call, ‎2 hr

[15/02/2025, 16:09:34] Andie: Hi Youmna! Was trying to give you a break
[15/02/2025, 16:09:48] Andie: But just letting you know that I have been doing some conceptual designs
[15/02/2025, 16:09:50] Andie: https://dr-youmna-mouhamad.jimdosite.com/
[15/02/2025, 16:10:35] Andie: i am selecting certain things to appear on this version and so far this is the structure Ive gone after

[15/02/2025, 16:14:07] Andie: I worked out that my hours on this would be of a traditional part time, 25hr week to complete the different stages of it at 15£/h
[15/02/2025, 16:17:28] Andie: The total comes to £375, which we can split into three equal installments of £125 each (1/3 of the total). Alternatively, it can be paid in two parts if that’s more manageable. All payments will be invoiced accordingly.
[15/02/2025, 16:17:52] Andie: Your inital thoughts will guide my refinement

[15/02/2025, 17:47:29] Andie: I understand you'd like to see

Navigation/Structure:

- Much simpler structure
- Speaking section should flow into Workshops

Structure should be:

- Home

- Speaking
- Workshops (as a natural flow from Speaking)

Logo/Tagline:

- Likes "Innovation" and "Legacy"
- Not sure about "Motivation" in the middle
- Wants something simpler

Content Flow:

Needs to think through content first to determine structure

Wants to include:

About Me (updated)
Services
Speaking

Self-awareness
Barriers to commercialisation

[15/02/2025, 20:50:18] Youmna (BYP): Yes this is more like it
[15/02/2025, 20:50:40] Andie: alright great I just redesign the conceptual logo for it
[15/02/2025, 20:50:45] Andie: this is simply a mock up
[15/02/2025, 20:51:06] Youmna (BYP): Cool

[17/02/2025, 22:26:13] Youmna (BYP): What do you think?
[17/02/2025, 22:38:26] Andie: Aaah I love it! This is genius
[17/02/2025, 22:38:49] Andie: And reminds so much of what Sharon shared on the group about Gusto Snacks and Giuseppe, who have been watching closely
[17/02/2025, 22:39:06] Andie: And has also done a fantastic job at Gorilla Marketing
[17/02/2025, 22:39:51] Andie: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guerrilla-marketing.asp
[17/02/2025, 22:40:23] Andie: Pretty sure it’s come your way before but I think its pretty underestimated
[17/02/2025, 22:40:59] Andie: The only thing I’d say your enunciation when recounting the anecdotes and drawing parallels
[17/02/2025, 22:41:16] Andie: Just as excited, been doing lots of experimenting
[17/02/2025, 22:41:47] Youmna (BYP): I didn't understand
‎[17/02/2025, 22:41:57] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[17/02/2025, 22:43:18] Andie: The only thing I’d suggest is to focus on speaking clearly when telling stories and making connections between them. Sometimes, certain words or details might not come across as clearly as they could, which can make it harder for people to follow along.
[17/02/2025, 22:43:25] Andie: Hahaha
[17/02/2025, 22:43:56] Andie: Not exactly but they are related
[17/02/2025, 22:44:23] Andie: Pronunciation refers to how you say a word—the correct sounds, stress, and intonation. For example, saying “tomato” as “to-mah-to” vs. “to-may-to” is about pronunciation.

Enunciation is about clarity and articulation—how clearly you say your words so they are easy to understand. If someone speaks too fast or mumbles, their enunciation might be unclear, even if their pronunciation is correct.
[17/02/2025, 22:45:36] Andie: That’s why I said pay more attention to that cause your pronunciation has never really been a problem you are a great and very emotionally intelligent speaker in that your style of speaking carrys impact
[17/02/2025, 22:45:56] Andie: So I believe this gorilla approach will be revolutionary coming from the founder

[17/02/2025, 22:47:55] Andie: Its different, fun etc
[17/02/2025, 22:48:31] Andie: Exactly!!! We humans are pretty predictable and definitely are more pulled by things that dont look all polished and the same

[17/02/2025, 22:49:21] Youmna (BYP): Cool guy
[17/02/2025, 22:49:38] Andie: And its really spinning the narrative of the unjustly treated to I have the power of my narrative
[17/02/2025, 22:49:50] Andie: What a beautiful day 😂
[17/02/2025, 22:49:55] Youmna (BYP): He turned them in ridicule lol lol
[17/02/2025, 22:50:00] Youmna (BYP): Indeed
[17/02/2025, 22:50:29] Andie: Exactly even that he could have gone the court way but now is the public display that will get them to come down their ivory tower and pay attention
‎[17/02/2025, 22:51:52] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[17/02/2025, 22:51:57] Andie: Engagement on LinkedIn is very interesting I studied their algorithm taking courses from the platform itself and still am cause I find that there’s more organic movement and engagement
[17/02/2025, 22:52:34] Andie: Yeah and not forgetting to have fun with it! Isnt it? Theres day and days full of highs and lows ‎<This message was edited>
[17/02/2025, 22:52:55] Andie: Its doesn’t have to be all doom and gloom

[18/02/2025, 09:21:09] Andie: Yes!
[18/02/2025, 09:21:54] Andie: Quickest way could probably be from this site but then going forward its worth having a convertor on your pc
[18/02/2025, 09:22:21] Andie: https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-to-mp3
[18/02/2025, 09:25:21] Youmna (BYP): Cool I will try that
[18/02/2025, 09:25:39] Youmna (BYP): How is job hunting going?
[18/02/2025, 09:28:46] Andie: Throwing applications around and talking to recruiters on and off that promise me roles but I then dont hear anything from afterwards
[18/02/2025, 09:29:29] Andie: So ive just decided to split my time between continuing my search and completing your speaker site and other projects coming my way
[18/02/2025, 09:29:54] Andie: If it gives u any trouble just hola at me🙋‍♂️
[18/02/2025, 09:39:09] Andie: Like you said here, It’s also important to create your own opportunities and I figured this would be possible too if I look at ways to create success for others lending my time, experiences, expertise
[18/02/2025, 10:04:42] Youmna (BYP): That is the spirit 👊🏾. In sha Allah the right job will come on time for you. God is working in the shadows.  

Let me know if you need help with interview preparation
[18/02/2025, 10:11:06] Andie: I think its great that you’re considering concealing the little girl identity but why dont you do so with blur instead

[18/02/2025, 10:13:04] Andie: A quick way to go about it would be to use something like this that does it for you but u do have Canva pro which has inbuilt this kind of tools too ‎<This message was edited>
[18/02/2025, 10:13:51] Andie: https://www.iloveimg.com/blur-face

[18/02/2025, 10:36:54] Andie: All are YT shorts: https://youtube.com/shorts/qEVmIF5g3SA?si=h-nseH_2wIvvXaq4
[18/02/2025, 10:40:46] Andie: Also careful in not letting the clip of you speaking with Steven overshadow your voice or viceversa, you can cut out ur voice there so parts of what its interesting in the video with with Steven is audible and the rest its just overtaken by your voice over cause it makes sense that not all the content in that raw captured clip will be of much interest
[18/02/2025, 10:41:01] Andie: Sorry for the msggs, just some feedback
[18/02/2025, 11:01:23] Youmna (BYP): Omg this is so cute
[18/02/2025, 11:02:18] Youmna (BYP): I can't seem to know how to do this
[18/02/2025, 11:02:27] Youmna (BYP): Thanks for the feedback
[18/02/2025, 11:03:00] Andie: I’ll prolly have to walk you through but if u’d rather another YT short can also find one perfect one for you to quickly digest
[18/02/2025, 11:03:30] Andie: Then it will be doable in CapCut and Canva, its platform agnostic tecniques used in editing
[18/02/2025, 11:03:30] Youmna (BYP): Sent me the Yt short
[18/02/2025, 11:03:35] Andie: cool
[18/02/2025, 11:03:53] Andie: This is ur content creation year😂😂
[18/02/2025, 11:04:00] Andie: Love that for you
[18/02/2025, 11:04:36] Youmna (BYP): I wasn't too bad. I did the script and video in 5 hours
[18/02/2025, 11:06:15] Andie: I was going to say—it’s really not bad at all! There’s a tech product reviewer who talked about the realities of editing, explaining how it can sometimes take a whole week just to create a few shorts or a 10-minute long-form video on a topic. So, you’re doing amazing, Youmna!

[18/02/2025, 11:07:10] Andie: It’s all about workflows. I can edit, and depending on the complexity, it could take more or fewer hours. Since you’re piecing together different parts—and often don’t know what you don’t know—you might end up taking the longer route than if you knew better one would. ‎<This message was edited>
[18/02/2025, 11:07:57] Youmna (BYP): I think the most difficult part is the script
[18/02/2025, 11:08:25] Youmna (BYP): I need to get better at taking pictures and videos of myself in this journey
[18/02/2025, 11:09:10] Andie: Yeah, most definitely! That would be relevant, worth your time, and a great reminder of how much you’ve grown and progressed. ‎<This message was edited>
[18/02/2025, 11:10:22] Andie: I completely agree! I’ll show you how this guy does it and see if it could work for you too, because I think it’s worth working smart—not just hard—once you’ve already put in the effort like you have: https://youtu.be/Qc6pdR8BhFA?si=0Ya7OoUGjpftoi1t

Entrepreneurs are already embracing it all. ‎<This message was edited>
[18/02/2025, 11:11:28] Andie: He talks about scripting for his newsletter here, and I think the way he presents it so well could really inform your workflow. It might even help you refine your approach, allowing you to nail it more quickly and with less pressure or stress—especially since you juggle so much, Youmna. ‎<This message was edited>
[18/02/2025, 11:11:50] Youmna (BYP): Thanks Andy!

[18/02/2025, 14:02:20] Youmna (BYP): LinkedIn family, I need your help, but before I have a confession to make! 



When I heard Steven Bartlett is looking to support 10 entrepreneurs with grit, vision, and early traction, I knew I had to share the story of how I hijacked his talk at IdeasFest 2022.



I attended the event with one goal: to speak to Steven Bartlett. Armed with an investment pack and a prototype of the Nyfasi Deluxe Detangler, I waited for my moment during the Q&A. I planned to ask a question, but the fire inside me said, "You only get one chance." Instead, I pitched on the spot and threw my detangler onto the stage. My basketball days are long behind me—I missed the stage—but Steven kindly came down the stage to pick it up. Even I was surprised by my boldness!



But that moment and my story reflects exactly what Steven is looking for:

✅ Entrepreneurs with resilience and lessons from struggle.

✅ A clear vision for solving a real problem.

✅ Hardworking, smart individuals with early traction.



Since Ideafstes I’ve launched my first 500 units of the Nyfasi Deluxe Detangler and sold half of them with minimal investment. This support would mean the world at this point. 🙏



Please support me by reposting, commenting, and tagging @Steven Bartlett. Every bit of support means the world. Let’s make this happen together!



P.S. Special thanks to Dylan and Francesca—this opportunity wouldn’t have been possible without you!

[07/03/2025, 10:32:54] Youmna (BYP): - Hello everyone

My name is Ouzayir ANTOY, and I am a third-year Bachelor’s student at INSEEC.
As I near the end of my studies, I am looking for a six-month internship in the fields of management, administration, or project management.

I am seeking a position as an assistant manager or project management assistant.

I speak both French and English and am highly motivated to join a dynamic team where I can contribute my organizational and management skills.

If you have any opportunities or contacts who might be interested, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Thank you in advance.
[07/03/2025, 10:56:17] Andie: Thanks for this

[07/03/2025, 10:58:36] Andie: Should definitely not just limit it to the UK market but any French speaking one too so leveraging having a dual LinkedIn page, I keep one in Italian for example
[07/03/2025, 11:03:38] Andie: the algorithm now rewards quality engagement, with engagement per post increasing by 12%.

[07/03/2025, 11:58:32] Andie: I've reviewed the latest information on the LinkedIn algorithm for 2025, and here are the key takeaways that we need to implement in our strategy:

*Organic reach is down, but engagement is up*: Organic reach has decreased significantly, but engagement per post has increased. This means our content needs to be more engaging to stand out.

*Ad space is increasing*: There are more ads on the platform, so our organic content needs to be even more compelling to compete.

*Frequency and Format Matter*: Posting 1-2 times daily leads to growth. Carousels and PDFs are performing significantly better than other formats.

*Comments are Crucial:* Longer, more thoughtful comments are favored over short or AI-generated ones. Engaging in comments on our own and others' posts is vital.

*Video reach has dropped*: Video reach is down considerably. If we use videos, they must be incredibly engaging.

*Dwell time is key*: Content that keeps users engaged for longer (like infographics and carousels) performs best. Longer captions can also achieve this.

*Top creators post daily:* Top 1% creators post every day, engage heavily, and use well-formatted, dense content (primarily carousels and cheat sheets).

*Action items*:

-Prioritize creating carousels and PDFs.
-Engage with posts regularly, especially our own.Consider the impact of reduced video reach.
-Ensure all posts have strong hooks and data visualization where possible.
-Aim for post lengths of 800-1000 words when appropriate. ‎<This message was edited>

[07/05/2025, 07:01:37] Andie: *Morning Youmna!*

Apologies, I didn’t get a chance to follow up with you yesterday. After work I had a meeting with Plamedi and the team. 

We were formally offboarding the intern who decided to leave, and spent some time documenting the process to make it reproducible for her going forward. 

That then evolved into a wider discussion around managing digital growth, development priorities, and the resource constraints in her business; especially with her wanting to be a lot more hands-off than before. ‎<This message was edited>
[07/05/2025, 07:10:08] Andie: I also mentioned you raising SEIS in that context.
[07/05/2025, 07:10:35] Andie: I’ll try to pop by today if you’re still around, but I’m working at the moment so it’ll likely be closer to noon if that works for you.

[07/05/2025, 07:57:30] Andie: I am also telling one of my biz mentors that has desperaretely wanted your comb for the longest time, this is the mother I told you about that lives in Exeter Devon.
[07/05/2025, 07:58:02] Andie: I'll leave you a msgg later on, on what her feedback is on it.

[07/05/2025, 12:31:24] Andie: Its nice cause it gives you virtual cards for u to dispose of if u want to use them onlone etc and the card can be used to withdraw cash from atm in other currencies bypassing the atm fees that would otherwise convert the amount and take a service fee
[07/05/2025, 12:32:25] Andie: So the card you insert act as tho is the card of that country but you first need to set the right currency to work on your card and then it will automatically detect that u are withdrawing from your Euro pot or US one if the ATM only dispense Dollars for example

[23/05/2025, 08:36:50] Andie: These are all valuable teaching moments! I never imagined I’d find myself on the path to becoming a Product Manager but here I am. Ironically, project management was my weakest module at university, and now life has brought me full circle. I'm navigating the intertwined challenges of people management, product strategy, and requirements gathering. It's humbling, a bit chaotic, but deeply rewarding.

I reminded even strongly by this post of AI gurus debating on LinkedIn hahah! Its a sobering one! PM and PO are ever needed, Product Managers and Product Owner. 

Btw its really helpful for startup likes yours if you want to remain focus on having solid documentation by a veteran who has created a custom ChatGPT specialisised in this check out the free one first: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-G5diVh12v-chatprd-ai-for-product-managers


then her more refinied one based on that free one for ones who has experience the benefit of it: https://www.chatprd.ai/

 A PRD translates that narrative ("joyful haircare for Black women and girls") into tangible product development efforts. It connects the founder's story to features, UX (user experience) decisions, and manufacturing specs.

The PRD becomes a single source of truth for:

Engineers or manufacturers (e.g. specs for the applicator mechanism)

Marketers (e.g. key messages and benefits)

Customer support (e.g. explaining how to use the product)

Advisors or investors (e.g. what’s being built and why) ‎<This message was edited>

[03/07/2025, 08:32:43] Andie: They are trained on hours and hours of recorded human-to-computer interaction, until then they have a model that, upon being instructed, can in real time spend time going through the entire web like a human would after it has learnt to do so. 

So, they give it access to mouse, keyboard, and browser in an isolated environment to do its thing.

[05/07/2025, 12:15:10] Andie: •	“Be Radiant”

	•	Sounds like a motivational phrase

	•	Empowering and affirming — “Be your radiant self”

	•	“Braid” + “Radiant”

	•	Combines the product focus (braiding) with the result (radiance)

	•	Clever fusion of form and function

	•	“Braid” is phonetically embedded

	•	When spoken aloud, “Braidiant” clearly includes “braid”

	•	Reinforces the brand’s core service

	•	“B RADIAN T” (visual pun)

	•	Resembles a tech/engineering term (“radian” is a unit of angle)

	•	Adds a subtle nod to robotics and precision ‎<This message was edited>

not sure if you'd have some time to help craft a strong application so that I can go full time and build the teacher training platform I always told you about. got the idea as explainer that I can send u separately, just that you applied before so I wanted to see since its says deep tech if my tech was deep enough and worth of the fellowship😂😂 ‎<This message was edited>

[13/08/2025, 17:14:20] Andie: its definitely deep tech tho I have realised. Wow in Europe! that's literally why I am name dropping u every where cause u are the closest person to someone who's dealt with them I remember and it did you well
[13/08/2025, 17:15:33] Andie: thank you! fortunately I have the recording for when you advised on the entire project. I have literally just based it all on deep pedagogy, learning science, computer science principle and computational thinking for the AI era, AI is the cheery on the cake but everything else has to work before we even start talking about AI.
[13/08/2025, 17:26:35] Youmna (BYP): Sharon is such a huge contributor to waitress to Wales

[20/08/2025, 11:57:29] Andie: Hi Dr Youmna!! pleas do refer to this connect creator and take some time to familiarise yourself with a few of the things she brings down to earth. I am point out this particular video cause I feel is the one that speaks most about what I believe is going in your sis life and beyond: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNkDS_oOhon/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

[21/08/2025, 12:22:13] Andie: But I’ll check all of these things out too. I think I am gonna have to be a lot more patient and more critical about the entire venture and de-risking wherever I can cause even the investors road seems like such an uphill battle. Cause unreplicability isn’t a straightforward path at all and you do feel like you need some spark of genius 🥲

[21/08/2025, 12:25:49] Andie: Yeah i was fortune enough that he called out a few of these ones, I can be applying for. So I am nevertheless gonna put in an application, based on all the feedback i received and then see from there. He said I definitely need to phrase better my USP, and understand more my Ideal Customer Profiles. ‎<This message was edited>

[25/08/2025, 21:48:27] Andie: I juse wanted to share this with you, if you could have a quick read through when you have a moment, as I am submitting it, tomorrow morning round 8/9am uk time. deadline is tomorrow afternoon I think, struggling to find it again but will find it.

[26/08/2025, 04:46:46] Andie: I am just left injecting well into it the market analysis

[26/08/2025, 14:18:01] Andie: no you are the only feedback ive been able to get
[26/08/2025, 14:19:23] Andie: cause you were the one that at the most experience ive thought, but that's together with the guys at RAE who did give me fieedback on the fly but it was very much similar that's what made you ask you if this was enough "laymans" terms friendly and digestable but if its not then I know where I have gone wrong cause you seem to be telling me that too
[26/08/2025, 14:19:28] Andie: thank you1
‎[26/08/2025, 14:20:56] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[26/08/2025, 14:39:07] Andie: yeaaah it makes perfect sense, I am so deeply into my engineering vocubalary that I am not having enough simplified ways of thinking about it. So I think I am going to just take some time to frame it better. I have 1h20min ish
‎[26/08/2025, 15:17:39] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[26/08/2025, 15:22:44] Andie: Okay thank u I feel a little bit pressured cause i wished i had spend longer over weeks instead of just the last two weeks but then again im doing everything alongside everything so it is just what it is.
[26/08/2025, 15:23:12] Andie: Lets see how it goes in the next 10-15min

[26/08/2025, 15:59:28] Andie: you actually right, its so interesting how it teaches you so much. it really hasn't been a waste of time, it keeps humbling me
[26/08/2025, 15:59:32] Andie: 😂
[26/08/2025, 16:00:43] Andie: she shall keep being humbled sis, I always tell myself the day you stop learning is the day you start dying so embrace all the failures and harsh feedbacks as conduit to your success. the better you become at it, the better at really putting sth out there. thanks for never ceasing to remind me of that!
[26/08/2025, 16:01:17] Andie: I figured it was going to be unrealistic at this point but wanted to try any ways cause I had to prove to myself that I could think of my feet more for sth Ive truly believed in for over 2 years.

[26/08/2025, 16:10:49] Andie: Few min before 4pm. Didnt wanna stress u too much with it cause ive taken it as a learnings
[26/08/2025, 16:11:24] Andie: i learning to be extra patient with myself as my ambitions often cause me to realise that i have gaps i need to patiently feel and its hard but it aint impossible
[26/08/2025, 16:11:48] Andie: Just trying to be the least delulu person and the most thoughtful

[28/08/2025, 05:09:26] Andie: this is what I had submitted.
‎[28/08/2025, 05:11:05] Youmna (BYP): ‎audio omitted
[28/08/2025, 05:11:21] Andie: upwards and onwords, submitted 5min before the time and we are in stage two. I think it was Agnus that reviewed, programme manager, as he is the one had that 1:1 I told you during the webinar and I noticed today he went over my linkedin but I wasn't sure why till I came across this, now wondering if my application failed.
[28/08/2025, 05:11:30] Andie: hahahahahaah
[28/08/2025, 05:12:41] Andie: i need to really humanise it, you have no idea ive here literally reading through white papers from big companies trying to think my whole engineering and they must have been pleased with something, so this is now what i am really trying to prepare for gosh!!!! this might be my opportunity😱
[28/08/2025, 05:13:11] Andie: it feels surreal sis, especially after u told me it sounded not human enough, but i have gone over it again anyways
[28/08/2025, 05:43:32] Youmna (BYP): In sha Allah
[28/08/2025, 05:47:33] Andie: thank you so much for all your help! the journey continue and it really is made of a thousand steps, I have figured im gonna have to remain level headed. very very not easy! but we fight our battles on our knees so shall it be.
[28/08/2025, 05:47:46] Andie: whatever i have to give birth to ill give birth to.

[28/08/2025, 14:07:20] Andie: the only place i named them in the application is to say i studied there even my address i kept it as my home one, as sole trader intending to register as LTD.

On the 2nd they have a webinar with their legal firm on IP, which is optional but i wwant to attend to gather the accurate IP knowledge to talk about it better at this stage too.

this is to help:

Why do I want to become an entrepreneur? Because solving this problem requires more than just good technology; it requires building a sustainable, mission-driven company. In three years, I see myself as the CEO of LAMPForge, leading a team that has established our platform as the gold standard for technical assessment in the UK.

My role will be to champion our vision, build the strategic partnerships with awarding bodies and government, and ensure that our technology always serves our core mission: to create equitable and verifiable pathways into the tech industry for all students.

I want to inspire the struggling current and next generation by being a visible role model. As a passionate STEAM Ambassador, and through my work with social enterprises like FirstGens, I am committed to proving that the most innovative engineering can and should come from diverse founders.
[22/09/2025, 16:20:54] Andie: they extended cause they had a system problem

[22/09/2025, 17:21:02] Andie: *For graduate applications only*, include one recommendation letter, of no more than two pages. The author should be able to comment on one or more of the following; your business proposition, the technology, your potential as an entrepreneur. This is essentially the same as a job reference, so they should be independent of you and the business - i.e. they will not benefit from you getting an award. Academic applicants do not submit a recomendation letter, this is covered already in sections 3 and 4. ‎<This message was edited>
[22/09/2025, 17:21:20] Andie: Sorry so short notice but this is from them
[22/09/2025, 18:19:15] Youmna (BYP): To the Selection Committee,

It is my absolute pleasure to write in support of Andy Kobi’s application. My name is Youmna Mouhamad, founder of Nyfasi and a 2020 awardee of the Royal Academy of Engineering Enterprise Fellowship. I have known Andy for several years, during which time I have had the privilege of watching him grow into a thoughtful, driven, and visionary individual who is now ready to take on the challenge of entrepreneurship.

From the very beginning of our relationship, Andy’s passion for technology and for making computing literacy more inclusive has been evident. He has long been a strong advocate for widening access to digital skills, particularly for those who face barriers to education, whether due to limited resources or learning difficulties. What has always struck me is not just his technical curiosity—though his knowledge of AI and its possibilities is extensive—but the way he connects this passion to a clear social mission. He genuinely believes that technology should serve people, and he has the determination to make that a reality.

Over the years, Andy has been a source of real insight, even educating me personally about AI tools that I could use to make my own startup, NaifRC, more effective and automated. His ability to share knowledge generously and practically has had a direct impact on me, and it reflects his deep commitment to ensuring that others can benefit from his expertise.

Andy also has excellent interpersonal skills. He always knows how to surround himself with people who complement his abilities, seeks advice with humility, and brings communities together around shared goals. These qualities, combined with his realism, make him an exceptional leader in the making. Just as importantly, he listens with empathy—a quality that I have observed in both professional and personal contexts. This ability to listen deeply, understand others, and respond thoughtfully is a leadership strength that I value enormously, and I believe it will serve him well as he builds his venture and inspires others.

Andy’s current venture is a perfect expression of his values and abilities. The platform he is developing uses AI not simply to give students answers, but to guide them step by step as they learn to build websites and applications across different programming languages. In a world where tools like ChatGPT can provide instant solutions, Andy understands that the true role of AI in education is not to shortcut learning but to scaffold it—to mentor, to prompt critical thinking, and to help learners develop independence and confidence. His vision fills a genuine gap: while traditional tutoring is often costly and inaccessible, his approach offers a scalable, supportive environment that benefits both students and educators.

As a former Enterprise Fellow myself, I also want to emphasise how strongly I believe Andy has what it takes to thrive in this programme. He is endlessly curious, hungry for knowledge, and disciplined in his approach. The Fellowship offers a wealth of expertise, mentorship, and training, and I am certain that Andy will not only absorb this knowledge but will apply it with determination and rigour. Alongside this, Andy is one of the most coachable individuals I have encountered. He approaches feedback with openness and humility. This coachability will allow him to maximise the value of the Fellowship: whether learning from coaches, mentors, or peers, Andy will engage deeply, reflect meaningfully, and return with new ideas and sharper questions.

For all these reasons, I am proud to recommend Andy without reservation. I am confident he will make an outstanding entrepreneur and that his work will have a meaningful and lasting effect on both the education sector and the wider tech community. Most importantly, I know from my own experience as an RAE Fellow that Andy has the mindset, the resilience, and the hunger for growth to flourish in this opportunity and

Vitamin D and folate, they’re said to be common but i genuinely feel very low on energy most of the times so atm im just managing as best as i can with the supplements meds they gave me but im really hoping they help me find sth that for the longer term gives me back that energy cause it comes to times where i literally cannot do anything

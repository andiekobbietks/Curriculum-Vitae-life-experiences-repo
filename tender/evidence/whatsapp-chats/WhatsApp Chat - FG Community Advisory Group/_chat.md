[14/02/2024, 17:34:44] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Sorry guys. Not sure why the community chat wouldn’t let you all send messages!
[14/02/2024, 17:34:50] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi everyone! I hope the new year is treating you all well. ☺️ I’m very happy to welcome you all to the FirstGens Advisory Group. 👏🏽

As you know, we've set up this group to act as a community voice alongside our Advisory Board (comprised of experts in different business branches). 

I’ve asked you all individually, because I believe you bring a diverse range thought and experience to our strategy and delivery. 

Last year, over half a million students self identified as being first-generation to pursue university (Hepi dataset). WE are part of a community organisation that is the *first* to build targeted and personalised support. This is something new, bold and very special.

✍️How this will work: 

Throughout the year, I'll be reaching out through this group chat to get you involved with decision-making, ad hoc advice and projects. 

On that note…I'm super excited to share that we will be working with UCAS! They have agreed that there should be representation of first-generation students and further guidance for students looking to pursue university. I have an exciting project coming up, and I want you all involved (sharing ideas and providing feedback).

I'll be in touch very soon, but in the meantime….

Please introduce 📢 yourselves in the chat. We are planning a get-together this summer with our advisory board, which will be awesome. 🎉

[21/02/2024, 01:09:08] Emilija Marčinskaitė (FirstGens): Hi all! It’s amazing to join the advisory group with FG. I’m Emilija, a 2023 psychology grad from the University of Leeds. This September I begin a job as a consultant in the Asset & Wealth Management Department at Alpha FMC.

In the meantime I am travelling South America. However, I look forward to connecting with everyone and combining some bright ideas and coming up with some solutions! 

I’ll share my LinkedIn as well.
[28/02/2024, 07:59:30] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Morning everyone! 

First project is here.☺️ we have a few phases of partnership with UCAS. The first page will be about building a page about first-gen students, signposting FirstGens at the end!

Please share any thoughts (bullet points would be useful) on what would be useful on this page. Think about when you were a prospective student! 

Example page ➡️ https://www.ucas.com/undergraduate/applying-university/individual-needs/students-imprisoned-parents
[28/02/2024, 07:59:57] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Would love to use your ideas in our initial Brainstorm (planned for Sat)!
[28/02/2024, 08:02:22] Andie: Well-noted Alaya, thanks for the heads up, will have a good think about it and also look back at all that I have come across over the years, that could have set me up for success from the get go ‎<This message was edited>
[29/02/2024, 09:42:35] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Amazing. Could eveyone do the same please. I’ll give you all a call on the weekend to run through your thoughts. Thank you!
[29/02/2024, 10:51:01] Emilija Marčinskaitė (FirstGens): I dont know if I am being super slow here, but could you please clarify this task 🙈
‎[29/02/2024, 10:53:43] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): ‎audio omitted
[29/02/2024, 10:55:47] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Example of what could go on the webpage:

•what constitutes a first-gen? Definitions and examples 

•top things to think about if you are a first-gen


•where to find mentorship support 

•where to find scholarships thst could help cover costs in your first year
[29/02/2024, 10:57:44] Emilija Marčinskaitė (FirstGens): got it!! thanks, Alaya.
[29/02/2024, 11:03:17] Emilija Marčinskaitė (FirstGens): my suggestions: what is social mobility & what has it got to do with being a first gen? what are de&i initatives & what has it got to do with me being a first gen? Are there already initiatives, schemes or programs I can get involved in within my univeristy or outside of univiersty? What are the protected characterstics under the Equality Act 2010 & do I meet them? Should I disclose I am a first gen?
[29/02/2024, 11:19:28] Andie: well-noted thanks, will come back to this, have a few thoughts
[29/02/2024, 11:19:38] Andie: great clarification
[02/03/2024, 13:20:28] ~ Sahra: Hi all, I’ve had a look at the page. When I was back in sixth form applying for universities, what I wish I knew was how can I make the most of my time at university, where can I find relevant work experience, how can I build connections with industry leaders in my career field of interest, what does it mean to be a First Gen and what type of struggles will I go through compared to non first-gens.
[02/03/2024, 15:50:36] ~ Nate: I think as well we need to pay attention to the social aspects of university too - I wrote this ages ago now for the FG Blog (https://www.firstgens.co.uk/firstgen-blog/building-self-confidence-at-university) and I think our UCAS section would benefit from explaining about how societies at university work, making friends etc..
[02/03/2024, 21:07:08] Andie: That was a great read @⁨~Nate⁩ bravo for putting together such a strong and constructive piece
[02/03/2024, 21:29:03] Andie: I think for myself, I was always motivated by the statistics of people in my community that did not always successfully follow through a university course and chose instead to dropout, and I have always believed that if like myself they were able to see better real models around them and connect with them early and understand better what Simon Sinek describes as their own "golden circle", they could have had better clarity from early and build self-belief contrary to the voices outside.

[02/03/2024, 21:43:32] Andie: so key points for the proposed UCAS webpage supporting prospective first-generation university students, with an emphasised focus on collapsible alumni student testimonials:

These are profiles featuring also current first-generation university students from a wide variety of degree programs and backgrounds. 

These should highlight:

* Inspirational learnings/testimonials detailing their hesitations about pursuing higher education and how they overcame self-doubt and especially the common phenomena of "imposter syndrome", more visibly anecdotes about key mentors who motivated them to consider university, I had one in sixthform that really help me get the full picture of Higher Education
* Stories showcasing the transformational impact of university on them and their families
* Bespoke practical information explaining the overall university application process in clear, simple terms (personal statements, deadlines, interviews etc). Using diverse case-studies that reflects a firs-gens journey of obstacles. I know this one is common to see nowadays on UCAS pages, but it's either I have grown quite used to the info or it just feels like very factually accurate yet quite broad and generic advise that most would hear in school anyways
• Tips on building self-confidence and breaking through "imposter syndrome" as an underrepresented student. Such as the one that @⁨~Nate⁩ wrote about, links over time can become broken but it would be useful for them to embed a few to save prospect students time
• Guidance on navigating student finance, most especially scholarships and bursaries specifically available to first-generation students, so ones they would most likely be approved on and also some templates to get them going as it can be an overwhelming process
• Budgeting advice and information on part-time work options to ease anxiety about tuition and living costs, so a more tailored  element of financial literacy, especially in this uncertain economical times, where a financial cushion goes a long way
• Downloadable resources to help parents/family members better understand the process and support their first-generation students, as some are really keen but do not have user-friendly guide to take them through understanding all its intricacies

Dear X Team,

I am a current student/alumni and wanted to share details of an event that I believe will be of interest to the team.


As you may know, The Office for Students has now included first-generation students in the new Equal Opportunity Risk Register. In collaboration with University of Bristol and UCL, we are holding the first national conference to discuss how university providers can better support students who are the first-generation to attend university. FirstGens flagship event will raise awareness, share research learnings, provide best practices and tackle challenging questions.

By way of introduction, FirstGens is a royal award-winning social enterprise that supports undergraduates who are the first-generation in their family to attend university. Helping to reduce the progression gaps across access, attainment, completion and graduate destinations. 
 
Universities UK, CASE, Million Plus and Wonkhe and Russell Group have all helped to promote this event, showing their commitment to enhancing support for first-generation students.

[29/05/2024, 05:59:07] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Morning,

Over 200 registrations for our launch event.🚀🎉

Thanks to those who shared with their universities. If you haven’t already, you can still send so it’s on their radar! 

Thanks so much

[19/06/2024, 20:59:13] Andie: @⁨Alaya (1st Gen CEO)⁩ I do not think I can contain my excitment, this is so profesh!!! goodness me I love it to bits. Really difficult to pick out imperfection and whatnot. ‎<This message was edited>
[19/06/2024, 21:05:48] Andie: I love even more the migration you made from the previous Content Management System platform to the new one, Sanity. It seems to offer greater customisation and creative freedom while making things look much less cluttered. The visual impact is much more refined, and the color palette is rich yet not overpowering. I am also pleased to see the featuring finally appearing prominently as you scroll, giving FirstGens the social proof it needed. Although it didn't need more validation, recognition amplifies the great work that FirstGens does.

[05/07/2024, 11:26:24] ~ Nate: With the election result today I think it’s more important than ever we mobilise our ambitions with firstgens to try and make an impact on government directly. We have a first-gen PM and a Labour government that will likely actually listen to us fully. Now is the time!
[05/07/2024, 11:58:37] Andie: I really do agree with you Nate, I think FirstGens could really make important strides here, if it seizes the moment we're in, there is going to be a lot on the new government agenda to address.

[19/07/2024, 11:51:55] ~ Nate: I think it’s a good thing. The personal statement system was inherently unfair if you were at a selective school or private school because the facilities they had there to help people write a statement were unmatched compared to those in state schools. It’s better to have more guided questions like this, it’ll make the process fairer in admissions to the top universities.
[19/07/2024, 11:52:52] ~ Nate: Especially the private schools, which some had banks of successful oxbridge personal statements they could use as templates
[19/07/2024, 12:06:18] Andie: Interesting point Nate, thanks for the contribution
[19/07/2024, 12:06:57] Andie: This is what I feared was the current state of affairs
[19/07/2024, 12:07:55] Andie: Which exacerbated the performance of first in their family to apply to historically prestigious/exclusive places
[19/07/2024, 12:10:18] ~ Nate: Exactly, this is where I feel like a lot of people misunderstand the mark. Just because Cambridge (for example) doesn’t directly let someone in due to the family anymore, doesn’t mean the issue is fixed. The issue remains vested in the culture capital these people have over others to know ‘how’ to apply to Oxbridge etc.
[19/07/2024, 12:10:27] ~ Nate: Which trickles down into the institutions they pay to access
[19/07/2024, 12:11:39] Andie: That is such a good key point that Cultural Capital, that I think FirstGens even with its collab with UCAS alone has helped tremendously closing and will continue do so with more of the platform it will build
[19/07/2024, 12:12:23] ~ Nate: It’s like when people use the same logic behind “but we do have a female executive” to prove they hire diversely. Doesn’t mean it’s ‘easier’ for these people to access those roles
‎[19/07/2024, 12:13:25] ~ Nate: ‎image omitted

[19/07/2024, 12:14:22] Andie: I would like to reshare also what Alaya put out into our channels way back, cause its very so timely
[19/07/2024, 12:14:28] Andie: Ever been so but even more so now

[19/08/2024, 14:09:20] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi everyone, 

Need your help! 

Would love to get your input in our brand values. These are our current brand values and they reflect the way we think about our brand.
These will be our fundamental principles and beliefs that guide FirstGens’ actions and decision-making. They represent what we stand for and believe in.😁

Our Chair, Urfan, came up with a great acronym ‘SEED’. This fits nicely with our earthy colours that represent growth and the idea of a level 1, 2 and 3 programme which will signify rooting, rising and flourishing over the 3 years of support while at uni.

The problem is that we don’t have anything for ‘D’.  Could you please share any ideas in the chat! Does’t have to be a serious one either.

Student Centric 
Empowering 
Educational 
D - ?

[19/08/2024, 14:12:31] Andie: Thats awesome! I do have a few in mind
[19/08/2024, 14:12:34] Andie: Dream-building - Focusing on helping students achieve their aspirations.
[19/08/2024, 14:12:50] Andie: Daring - Encouraging students to step out of their comfort zones and take on new challenges.
[19/08/2024, 14:13:27] Andie: Diverse - Emphasising inclusivity and the variety of backgrounds your students come from.

Thats been a huge one at FirstGens
[19/08/2024, 14:14:17] Andie: finally: Dynamic - This could represent the ever-changing nature of education and FirstGens adaptability to students' needs.
[19/08/2024, 14:15:03] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Love it. Thanks so much!
[19/08/2024, 14:15:25] Andie: Absolute pleasure, lets go🌱

I’ve been awarded the Young Innovator Award by the Fair Education Alliance! Bringing a 25k grant into FG. Our largest grant pot to date! 

This means…a paid member of staff to help out with the operations.😅

In an interesting turn of events, I will be abseiling my office building (15 floors!) tomorrow afternoon in aid of Marie Curie. 

Any donations would be greatly appreciated! If you are unable to donate, please could you share my JustGiving page to help me reach as many people as possible? Thank you in advance! 

I really appreciate your support. ❤️

[24/10/2024, 12:28:37] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hello all! 

Sorry I've been inactive with updates! I experienced my first bout of burnout and was advised to take some time off. 

All is well and reclaimed my mojo back! My focus is now delegating operational tasks to the board, enabling more strategic capacity. 

Positives!

✅lots of engagement to hear from FirstGens/talks and training.

✅4 unis interested in working with us next year - in-person meetings have been set up.

✅Created clear roles for manegement for future volunteers to reports to.

✅ Funding opportunities from contacts within Fair Education Alliance. I'm undertaking their education innovation programme and working in London twice a month. PS...the best programme I have ever been part of. Really strengthening our organisational model and strategies. 

✅Meeting booked between myself, researchers at UCL and UCAS. We are hopeful we can change the UCAS FG question to make it more clear for students and in turn produce more accurate stats on the number of first-gen students. 

Hope you are all keeping well.🫶🏽 ‎<This message was edited>

[03/12/2024, 19:20:42] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hello team, 

Your support is needed🚨

The Directors and I are deciding on the annual activities delivered at FirstGens. We want your input to shape our future initiatives.🙌

We’ve put together a short questionnaire (only takes 10 minutes!) to: 

💬 Hear your thoughts on our current approach 
🔑 Validate the key barriers we’re focusing on 

Your feedback will directly impact how we support first-gen students moving forward, so we’d love to hear from our community!

⏰ Deadline: Thur 5th is when the Director's are meeting in-person to discuss this. Would be super helpful if we received answered before then!  


Thank you so much for your time and support. If you have any questions, let me know. 

Take the survey here - https://forms.gle/tSxP6x7Ges6bv7gt8
[16/12/2024, 12:00:56] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Morning everyone! Just checked in on the survey results and we've only had 2 responses from our Community Advisory group. 

Would be super helpful if you could put 10 mins aside to help out. This survey is critical in enabling us to move forward! 

Thank you☺️
[17/12/2024, 12:21:29] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hello all. A reminder that the deadline for the survey is today at 6pm! 

Would be awesome if you could let me know if you've completed it via message or responding to this message with an emoji. 

Thank you!

A HUGE thank you for the continued support, contributions alongside laughter and inspiration. 

You guys are great. 

I hope the newsletter fills you with pride and joy.💐

The advisors and directors celebrated yesterday evening in Bristol, but I hardly took any photos. 😂

Enjoy your breaks, have a fab festive season and wishing you all a prosperous new year.🤝

[20/12/2024, 12:39:46] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hey guys! I need to be in London twice a month for the next 6 months for the Fair Education Alliance programme and the start times are now 9am which means hefty peak train tickets over £100.

If anyone has a spare room, do let me know.😇
[06/01/2025, 10:50:29] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi everyone! Wishing you all a great start to the new year.😁

Unsurprisingly, I've got a cold,🤧 regardless of how many ginger and turmeric shots I take.😅

Personally, reminding myself that it's still winter season and to ease into work!

‼️In January, we'll prioritise restructuring the team, including our Community Advisory Group.

Several memebers of the existing Advisory 'Board' and Directors have agreed to undertake more hours a month which will increase capacity!

We've rooted our foundations and risen🌱by raising awareness within the higher education sector. 

We are ready for growth! 

For the next stage of FG, we are going to need some serious people power and hands on deck. 

-launching a platform 
-getting our community together in-person / delivering for community 
-a significant increase in content development to populate platform 
-increase of university partnerships 
-recruiting another part-time member of staff to run programmes annually 

 
As you may remember, Jess sent a survey to understand what you might be able to help with as a volunteer in the Community Advisory Group. 

We will be changing how we run the group to ensure we use your skills for the benefit of our community. 

Look forward to catching up with you all soon.😁 ‎<This message was edited>

[27/03/2025, 10:39:45] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi everyone,

It feels like I’ve had my head down, focused on securing funding and recruiting key roles like finance and programme coordinators - only coming up for air now and then!

I’m so stoked to share that we’ve laid the foundations with our website, brand updates, and leadership team. This year, we’re getting back into action with:

➡️ Delivering the Navigating University programme this summer

➡️ Launching our annual First-Generation Awareness Training for staff. 

➡️ Building and testing our EdTech platform. Including all previous blogs  and webinars!

Our vision is that within three years, we’ll have a full programme supporting students from Year 1 through to Year 3. This will include engaging digital content on a platform and app, integrated with AI to enhance the experience.

By supporting students across the full lifecycle, we’ll also create a pipeline of talent for corporate partners looking to advertise their internships and graduate roles.

Now that we know what’s needed, we’ll be reaching out to see if you’d like to join us in a specific volunteer role.

And for those keen to get involved, I’ll make sure you’re part of delivering the Navigating University programme!

We'll need some support building content for the on-demand part of the platform.📽️ Our video content will be repurposed into smaller clips for social media! 

Excited for what’s ahead! ‎<This message was edited>
[20/05/2025, 08:20:05] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi everyone!

Exciting updates! We’ve just welcomed a new Programme Manager, Josie, to the team.

Today we’re launching the Navigating University Programme in partnership with UWE and QML. 

We’re also opening up access to students referred by our partner organisations. While we have a pipeline of warm partner universities, including Uni of Bris, at this moment of time, our focus is making the ultimate support programme, rather than expanding universities. 

Re this year's programme...we are piloting the 'pre-arrival' webinars - a direct response to student feedback asking for more support before they start university.

I’ll be involving you all in upcoming panels and events, so stay tuned!

Apologies for being quiet lately...I’ve been juggling quite a bit: travelling to London every two weeks for the Fair Education Social Enterprise Setup Programme, securing funding for our new financial year, and onboarding brilliant new team members including Josie, Awuwa (Finance Coordinator), and our new Comms Lead. 

This has been awesome! Though, I have been running on a thin line of burnout and still in the process of delegating leadership, not just tasks and objectives. I'm getting there! 

I’ll be back in touch soon with our updated 3-year strategy.🙌🏽

Thanks for your patience and support!

Look forward to getting you all involved. 

I know Josie (our new programme manager) has been in touch with a few of you about the live programme kicking off next month. 

If not, she'll be in touch about being a guest speaker for the upcoming workshops. 

We are getting the ball rolling!!

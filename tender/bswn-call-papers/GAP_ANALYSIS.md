---

## 2. Requirements PARTIALLY MET ⚠️

### 2.1 Microsoft Partner Validation

**Requirement Level:** Implicit (not explicitly stated in call)  
**Proposal Evidence:** Section 3: "Microsoft engineers review my Azure design via Partner programme"  
**Status:** ⚠️ **COMMITMENT MADE, PENDING EXECUTION**

**Analysis:**  
Andrea commits to Microsoft Solutions Architect review through Microsoft for Startups/Nonprofit programme. However, this is a future action rather than completed credential.

**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Mitigation:** Andrea has proven track record securing $5,000 Azure facility for Nyfasi (2020), demonstrating ability to navigate Microsoft verification processes.

**Recommendation:** Request confirmation of Microsoft Partner programme eligibility during contracting phase.

---

### 2.2 Heritage Sector Direct Experience

**Requirement Level:** Desirable (not mandatory)  
**Proposal Evidence:** Partnership with Cables & Cameras CIC (Gary Thompson); no prior completed heritage platform delivery  
**Status:** ⚠️ **ADJACENT EXPERIENCE, NOT DIRECT**

**Analysis:**  
Andrea brings:
- ✅ Cultural competency (published research on Black identity)
- ✅ Community technology platforms (NavigateU for FirstGens)
- ✅ Partnership with heritage professional (Gary Thompson)
- ❌ No completed digital heritage/museum platform in portfolio

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Mitigation:** Gary Thompson's cultural heritage expertise combined with Andrea's technical delivery fills this gap. Lovable.dev rapid prototyping allows community validation before full build.

**Recommendation:** Ensure Gary Thompson's involvement is contractually secured as co-consultant throughout project.

---

## 3. Gaps and Missing Items 🔍

### 3.1 Project Risk Register

**Gap Type:** Documentation  
**Severity:** MINOR

**Analysis:**  
Proposal includes comprehensive technical approach and security architecture but does not provide explicit project risk register with:
- Risk identification (e.g., community disengagement, technology adoption barriers)
- Risk assessment (likelihood × impact)
- Mitigation strategies
- Contingency plans

**Impact:** Low - risks are implicitly addressed through technical choices (Wazuh monitoring, Lovable prototyping, community beta testing) but not formally documented.

**Recommendation:**  
Request formal Project Risk Register as part of WP1 discovery phase deliverables. Include:
- Technical risks (platform scalability, voice preservation quality)
- Community risks (engagement barriers, digital literacy gaps)
- Financial risks (Microsoft/ElevenLabs grant rejection scenarios)
- Timeline risks (dependency on external approvals)

---

### 3.2 Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan

**Gap Type:** Documentation  
**Severity:** MINOR

**Analysis:**  
Section 3 mentions "business continuity and disaster recovery" as CIO responsibility, but no detailed DR/BCP plan provided in proposal.

**Required Elements:**
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Backup frequency and retention policies
- Data restoration procedures
- Failover scenarios (what if Azure UK South region fails?)

**Impact:** Low - Azure inherently provides redundancy, but formal DR/BCP documentation needed for NLHF compliance.

**Recommendation:**  
Include DR/BCP as explicit deliverable in WP2 (Core Development) with quarterly testing schedule.

---

### 3.3 Community Training Materials Preview

**Gap Type:** Sample Deliverable  
**Severity:** MINOR

**Analysis:**  
WP5 includes "Staff training programme" but proposal does not provide sample training materials or curriculum outline.

**Desirable Preview:**
- Sample training module structure
- Learning outcomes for BSWN staff
- Assessment methods (how to verify staff competency?)
- Training delivery format (in-person, video, written guides?)

**Impact:** Low - training is committed deliverable, but no preview of approach provided.

**Recommendation:**  
Request training curriculum outline during contract negotiation to ensure alignment with BSWN staff learning preferences.

---

### 3.4 Post-Handover Maintenance Model

**Gap Type:** Clarity  
**Severity:** MINOR

**Analysis:**  
Section 8 describes "Post-Launch Support (Months 13-24)" as included maintenance, but lacks specificity:
- What constitutes "maintenance" vs "new feature development"?
- Response time SLAs (Service Level Agreements)?
- Escalation procedures?
- Annual maintenance day budget?

**Impact:** Low - commitment exists but terms undefined.

**Recommendation:**  
Define explicit Maintenance Service Level Agreement (SLA) including:
- Response times (critical vs non-critical issues)
- Scope boundaries (bug fixes vs enhancements)
- Annual day allocation (e.g., 5 maintenance days/year included)

---

### 3.5 ElevenLabs Impact Program Contingency

**Gap Type:** Dependency Risk  
**Severity:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Analysis:**  
Voice preservation strategy depends entirely on ElevenLabs Impact Program approval (free 12-month license).

**Contingency Question:** What if BSWN is not approved for Impact Program?

**Proposal States:** "I will apply on BSWN's behalf through the Impact Partnership programme" (Section 3)

**Risk Scenario:**  
- ElevenLabs Impact Program has eligibility criteria
- Application rejection would require alternative voice preservation solution
- No backup plan stated in proposal

**Impact:** Medium - voice preservation is core UnMuseum value proposition for oral history.

**Recommendation:**  
Request contingency plan:
- Alternative voice preservation technologies (Azure AI Speech, Google Cloud TTS)
- Budget allocation if ElevenLabs grant not secured
- Timeline adjustment if alternative solution requires different implementation

## 4. Recommendations 📋

### 4.1 Strengths to Leverage

#### Recommendation 1: Formalize Gary Thompson Co-Consultancy
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Action:** Ensure contractual agreement includes Gary Thompson (Cables & Cameras CIC) as cultural heritage co-consultant throughout project, not just introduction.

**Rationale:** Gary's heritage sector expertise compensates for Andrea's lack of direct museum platform experience. His involvement should be contractually protected.

**Implementation:** Request co-signed contract or subcontractor agreement clarifying Gary's role in WP1 (Discovery), WP3 (Narrative Advisory), and WP5 (Community Training).

---

#### Recommendation 2: Secure Microsoft and ElevenLabs Approvals Early
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Action:** Make WP1 milestone payment conditional on successful Microsoft nonprofit registration AND ElevenLabs Impact Program approval.

**Rationale:** Both are zero-cost dependencies that underpin budget model. Early confirmation de-risks entire project.

**Implementation:**  
- WP1.4: "Microsoft nonprofit registration - Tenant active with credits" must include proof of approval
- WP1.5: "ElevenLabs Impact Program application - License approved" must include 12-month confirmation

---

#### Recommendation 3: Capitalize on Research Validation as Marketing Asset
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Action:** BSWN should leverage Andrea's unique credentials (British Journal of Sociology publication, €212k EU Horizon 2020 research subject) in grant reporting and public communications.

**Rationale:** National Lottery Heritage Fund values evidence-based approaches. Andrea's academic validation provides credibility for decolonial archiving methodology.

**Implementation:**  
- Include Andrea's research in NLHF progress reports
- Reference Sarli (2022) and Varriale (2025) publications in UnMuseum launch communications
- Position UnMuseum as research-informed heritage platform

---

#### Recommendation 4: Establish Community Advisory Board
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Action:** Create formal Community Advisory Board drawn from Black Bristolian heritage bearers to guide WP1 (Discovery) and validate WP3 (Features).

**Rationale:** Andrea's commitment to "Nothing about us without us" requires structural accountability mechanism beyond individual consultation.

**Implementation:**  
- 5-7 member advisory board representing intergenerational perspectives
- Quarterly meetings during 24-week project
- Advisory board reviews WP1 research report and WP3 feature specifications before sign-off

---

### 4.2 Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Recommendation 5: Implement Weekly Sprint Reviews
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Action:** Adopt Agile sprint methodology with weekly demos to BSWN project lead throughout WP2-WP4.

**Rationale:** Andrea's proposal commits to "weekly progress reports" (Section 8) but weekly demos ensure continuous community validation, reducing risk of building wrong solution.

**Implementation:**  
- 1-hour weekly demo sessions (in-person or video)
- Clickable prototype updates via Lovable.dev
- Community member participation in demos where feasible

---

#### Recommendation 6: Require Open Source License Documentation
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Action:** Request explicit licensing documentation for all custom code and third-party dependencies as WP5 deliverable.

**Rationale:** Andrea commits to "zero vendor lock-in" and "open source" (Section 1), but no specific license specified (GPL, MIT, Apache?).

**Implementation:**  
- Include LICENSE.md file in all code repositories
- Document all third-party library licenses
- Confirm no proprietary code dependencies that restrict BSWN's future flexibility

---

#### Recommendation 7: Define Scope Change Process
**Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM  
**Action:** Establish formal scope change request process with impact assessment protocol.

**Rationale:** 24-week timeline is ambitious. Community co-design may surface requirements not anticipated in proposal.

**Implementation:**  
- Scope change request form template
- Impact assessment on timeline and budget
- Approval authority defined (BSWN Operations Director?)
- Change log maintained throughout project

---

### 4.3 Value-Add Opportunities

#### Recommendation 8: Explore Microsoft AI for Good Partnership
**Priority:** LOW  
**Action:** Andrea should investigate formal Microsoft AI for Good partnership for UnMuseum, beyond standard nonprofit credits.

**Rationale:** Andrea references "Microsoft AI for Good: Dedicated track for cultural preservation projects" (Section 3) and Microsoft's Hip Hop Museum partnership. UnMuseum could qualify for enhanced support.

**Potential Value:**  
- Featured case study on Microsoft AI for Good website
- Engineering support beyond standard partner programme
- Public relations value for BSWN (Microsoft-partnered heritage platform)

**Implementation:** Andrea to initiate Microsoft AI for Good application during WP1, with BSWN as primary partner organisation.

---

#### Recommendation 9: Document Digital Heritage Best Practices for Sector
**Priority:** LOW  
**Action:** BSWN should fund Andrea to produce open-source Digital Heritage Platform Implementation Guide as project output.

**Rationale:** Andrea's approach (Omeka S + Wazuh + ElevenLabs + Azure) could benefit other heritage organisations. Sharing knowledge builds BSWN's thought leadership.

**Additional Cost:** 3-5 days at £550/day = £1,650-£2,750  
**Value:** Positions BSWN as sector innovator, creates reusable asset for other Black heritage organisations

---

#### Recommendation 10: Connect BSWN with Andrea's Ecosystem
**Priority:** LOW  
**Action:** Facilitate introductions between BSWN and Andrea's existing partnerships (FirstGens UK, InnovateUK Business Connect, Technocamps).

**Rationale:** Andrea's "national ecosystem orchestration" (Section 1) could unlock additional funding streams or partnership opportunities for BSWN beyond UnMuseum project.

**Potential Opportunities:**  
- InnovateUK Innovation Funding for heritage technology
- FirstGens UK partnership for youth heritage engagement
- Technocamps STEM education integration with UnMuseum schools programme

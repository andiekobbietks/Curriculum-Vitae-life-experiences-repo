## Professional Profile

**Multi-disciplinary Technology Professional** operating at **SFIA Level 4–6** across 15 competencies, with experience spanning **8 organisations across 6 industries**. First Class dissertation on RAG architecture directly applicable to conversational discovery systems. 

**Intercultural Identity Pioneer**: First result for "Afro-European" on Google Search—codifying a transnational identity category through published media and academic research. This positions me uniquely to work on heritage platforms that centre marginalised narratives.

Published researcher featured in the *British Journal of Sociology* (November 2025) and Marie Curie research subject for the MIDIC project examining intercultural identity in the UK diaspora context.

## Academic & Identity Credentials

### Research Validation: An Inestimable Asset

**EU Horizon 2020 Marie Curie Research (Sarli, 2022)** — €212,000 Study
- Key participant in Dr Annavittoria Sarli's MIDIC project (Grant Agreements 841716/874979)
- Research validated how **Second Generation Individuals (SGIs)** cultivate **Intercultural Competence (IC)**—skills essential for the modern labour market
- Sarli's findings: SGIs are **"not to be seen as struggling but an inestimable asset"**—bicultural navigation is a strategic advantage, not a deficit

**British Journal of Sociology (Varriale, November 2025)**
- Featured as "Giovanni" in Dr Simone Varriale's peer-reviewed article: *"Meritocracy, Recognition and Double Consciousness: Why Black and Muslim Italians Move to (and Sometimes Leave) Post-Brexit Britain"*
- The "Double Consciousness" framework validates the ability to navigate multiple cultural systems simultaneously

### Algorithmic Representation: Proof of Engineering Visibility

**"Afro-European" & "Afro-Italian" Identity Codification**
- **First Google Search result** for "Afro-European" and top-ranking for "Afro-Italian"
- Through intentional representational data production, intervened in how algorithmic image-ranking systems surface Afro-European identity
- Interviewed for **Italics Magazine** "Being Afro-European" series (July 2022)—high-authority European publication that anchors this term in lived experience
- This proves **algorithmic visibility can be reshaped** by ethically constrained data environments—extending Dr Joy Buolamwini's algorithmic justice work from unmasking bias to **unmasking potential**

**Decolonising the Curriculum Advocate**
- Contributed to discourse that informed **USW's CommExp: Decolonise** initiative
- Identified systemic barriers in IT education for BAME students (April 2020)—overly Westernised curriculum despite internationally diverse student body

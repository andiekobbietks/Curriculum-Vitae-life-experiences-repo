## 1. Executive Summary

I am a first gen graduate and IT professional with deep expertise in web development, cloud infrastructure, and artificial intelligence solutions. My background uniquely combines technical proficiency with meaningful community engagement work, particularly with organisations supporting Black and racially minoritised communities.

**Why I am the right fit for the UnMuseum:**

- **Community-first approach**: Advisory roles with FirstGens CIC, Enprise/Italian Blackpreneurs, Irene Vera Foundation, and Di FELLOWS
- **Rapid prototyping expertise**: I build production-ready prototypes using Lovable.dev (2.3 million users), turning ideas into functional platforms within days
- **Product leadership**: Served as Product Owner for PRGRSS (April to July 2025), coordinating development teams across United Kingdom and Pakistan
- **AI integration specialist**: First Class dissertation on RAG architecture, 3,800 AI platform interactions in eight weeks
- **Microsoft compliance expertise**: Successfully secured $5,000 Azure AI facility for Nyfasi through Microsoft nonprofit programme
- **Not a single point of failure**: Microsoft engineers can review and vet my architecture, ensuring BSWN has ongoing support

**Connection to this opportunity**: Gary Thompson, Creative and Cultural Consultant at Cables and Cameras CIC Bristol, introduced me to BSWN and Mina Drobna.

\section{Technical Approach}

\subsection{What is Microsoft Azure?}

\textbf{Microsoft Azure} is Microsoft's cloud computing platform, similar to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud. It provides:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Web hosting}: Servers to run websites and applications without buying physical hardware
    \item \textbf{Database storage}: Secure places to store your data (heritage archives, user accounts)
    \item \textbf{AI services}: Ready-made artificial intelligence tools for search, voice, and image recognition
    \item \textbf{Security}: Enterprise-grade protection for sensitive community data
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why Azure for BSWN?} Microsoft offers \textbf{free credits for registered nonprofits} through the Microsoft for Nonprofits programme. I have successfully onboarded other organisations (Nyfasi, FirstGens) onto this programme, securing them free cloud infrastructure worth thousands of pounds annually.

\subsection{What I Will Procure and Set Up for BSWN}

As part of this project, I will \textbf{procure, set up, and harden} the following for BSWN at no additional cost:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\rowcolors{2}{lightgrey}{white}
\begin{tabular}{L{4cm}L{4cm}R{3cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Service}} & \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{What It Does}} & \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Value}} \\
\midrule
Microsoft 365 Business & Email, Teams, SharePoint, Office apps & \pounds2,500/year \\
Azure Nonprofit Credits & Cloud hosting, databases, AI & \pounds2,800/year \\
Azure Active Directory & Secure user login and identity management & Included \\
Microsoft Teams & Video calls, chat, collaboration & Included \\
SharePoint Online & Document storage and intranet & Included \\
OneDrive for Business & Personal cloud storage for staff & Included \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Microsoft 365 Suite Procurement (No Cost to BSWN)}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Why Can I Do This?}

At the University of South Wales (2023-2024), I served as both \textbf{Digital Technical Mentor} and \textbf{End User Computing Desktop Support}. My responsibilities included:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Delivering training sessions on \textbf{underutilised Microsoft 365 resources} to students and faculty
    \item Managing \textbf{Azure Active Directory accounts} for 23,000+ users across multiple campuses
    \item Providing hands-on support for \textbf{Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive}
    \item Creating documentation guides for \textbf{M365 administration and best practices}
    \item Supporting departmental \textbf{digital transformation initiatives}
\end{itemize}

I understand that many organisations do not fully utilise their Microsoft 365 subscriptions. I will ensure BSWN maximises the value of every tool included.

\subsection{Platform Architecture: Omeka S}

I propose building on \textbf{Omeka S}, an open-source digital heritage platform actively developed for 10 years (7,078 commits, 33 contributors, v4.2.0 December 2025).

\subsection{Microsoft Heritage: A Precedent}

Microsoft has direct experience in heritage technology. In 2019, they partnered with the \textbf{Universal Hip Hop Museum} in the Bronx to create immersive digital experiences preserving hip hop culture. This demonstrates Microsoft's commitment to cultural preservation using Azure cloud services, which we can leverage for BSWN through similar nonprofit partnerships.

\subsection{ElevenLabs Voice Preservation}

BSWN qualifies for the \textbf{ElevenLabs Impact Program}: 12 months FREE Pro licence (33 million characters, professional voice cloning). I will apply on BSWN's behalf to preserve oral histories in the community's own voices.

\subsection{Data Sovereignty}

\textbf{BSWN owns and controls all community data}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Azure UK South region (data never leaves the UK)
    \item Self-hosted database on BSWN's own tenant
    \item Full administrative handover to BSWN staff
    \item No vendor lock-in with open-source platform
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security: Wazuh Zero Trust}

\textbf{Wazuh} is a free, open-source security platform providing:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Intrusion detection (alerts if anyone tries to hack the system)
    \item Centralised logging (records of all system activity)
    \item Vulnerability scanning (finds security weaknesses before hackers do)
    \item GDPR compliance monitoring
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Not a Single Point of Failure}

I will ensure the project does not depend solely on me:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Microsoft engineer review via Partner programme
    \item Comprehensive documentation for future developers
    \item Open-source code BSWN can modify or extend
    \item Full knowledge transfer to BSWN staff
    \item Gary Thompson as ongoing relationship manager
\end{itemize}

\section{Commercial Terms}

\subsection{Engagement Structure}

I will be engaged as a \textbf{subcontractor under Gary Thompson / Cables and Cameras CIC}. This provides:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Clear accountability through established BSWN relationship
    \item Combined expertise in heritage technology and community engagement
    \item Gary as project manager and primary point of contact
    \item Structured invoicing through Cables and Cameras CIC
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IR35 Status and Tax Implications}

\subsubsection{What is IR35?}

IR35 (also called ``off-payroll working rules'') is UK tax legislation that determines whether a contractor should be taxed as an employee or as self-employed. Since April 2017, \textbf{public sector and medium/large private sector clients} are responsible for determining a contractor's IR35 status.

\subsubsection{Status Determination}

As BSWN is likely classified as a \textbf{medium-sized organisation}, BSWN (or Cables and Cameras CIC as the fee-payer) will need to:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Use HMRC's \textbf{Check Employment Status for Tax (CEST)} tool
    \item Produce a \textbf{Status Determination Statement (SDS)} with reasons
    \item Communicate this determination before the engagement begins
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{If Determined ``Inside IR35''}

If the engagement is determined to be inside IR35:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item The fee-payer deducts \textbf{Income Tax and National Insurance} before payment
    \item I receive payment similar to an employee (net of tax)
    \item \textbf{Travel and accommodation expenses cannot be claimed} through my limited company
    \item These expenses must be invoiced \textbf{separately to BSWN at cost}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{If Determined ``Outside IR35''}

If the engagement is determined to be outside IR35:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item I invoice through my limited company gross
    \item I manage my own tax affairs through Self Assessment
    \item Travel and accommodation can be claimed as business expenses
\end{itemize}

\subsection{My Invoicing and Tax Setup}

I operate with professional financial infrastructure compliant with UK Government standards:

\subsubsection{Mettle Business Banking}

\textbf{Mettle} is a free business bank account provided by NatWest, specifically designed for freelancers and contractors:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Professional invoicing}: Create and send branded invoices from the app
    \item \textbf{Payment tracking}: See what has been paid and chase late payments
    \item \textbf{Tax pots}: Automatically set aside percentages for tax obligations
    \item \textbf{FSCS protected}: Deposits protected up to \pounds85,000
    \item \textbf{NatWest backed}: Full banking infrastructure and security
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{FreeAgent Accounting Software}

\textbf{FreeAgent} is HMRC-recognised accounting software that:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Direct HMRC filing}: Submit Self Assessment tax returns directly to HMRC
    \item \textbf{Making Tax Digital (MTD) compliant}: Meets new government digital tax requirements
    \item \textbf{Automatic tax calculations}: Corporation Tax, VAT, and personal tax estimates
    \item \textbf{Bank feed integration}: Automatically imports transactions from Mettle
    \item \textbf{Invoice management}: Professional invoices with automatic payment reminders
    \item \textbf{Expense tracking}: Receipt capture and categorisation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{What the Government Requires}

The UK Government requires self-employed individuals and contractors to:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Register for Self Assessment} with HMRC
    \item \textbf{File annual tax returns} by 31 January each year
    \item \textbf{Pay Income Tax and National Insurance} on earnings
    \item \textbf{Keep records} for at least 5 years
    \item \textbf{Comply with Making Tax Digital} (digital record-keeping from April 2026)
\end{enumerate}

My Mettle + FreeAgent setup ensures full compliance with all these requirements, providing BSWN with confidence that invoices are professionally managed and tax obligations are met.

\section{Budget Breakdown}

\subsection{G-Cloud Rate Card Comparison}

The \textbf{Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA)} is the UK Government standard for IT skills and pricing. Below are published G-Cloud 14 rates compared to my proposed rates:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\rowcolors{2}{lightgrey}{white}
\begin{tabular}{L{3cm}C{3cm}C{3cm}C{3cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{\textcolor{primary}{SFIA Level}} & \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{G-Cloud Range}} & \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{UK Median}} & \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{My Rate}} \\
\midrule
Level 4 (Apply) & \pounds600-950/day & \pounds475/day & \pounds350/day \\
Level 5 (Ensure) & \pounds750-1,200/day & \pounds540/day & \pounds400/day \\
Level 6 (Initiate) & \pounds950-1,500/day & \pounds625/day & \pounds400/day \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{SFIA Rate Comparison (Sources: G-Cloud 14 Rate Cards, ITJobsWatch Jan 2026)}
\end{table}

\textbf{My rates are 50-70\% below G-Cloud framework rates}, reflecting my commitment to supporting community organisations while maintaining professional delivery standards.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Development Cost Breakdown}
\end{table}

\subsection{Travel and Accommodation (Billed Separately)}

Under IR35 rules, travel and accommodation for on-site work in Bristol \textbf{cannot be included in day rates} if the engagement is determined ``inside IR35''. These will be invoiced separately at cost:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\rowcolors{2}{lightgrey}{white}
\begin{tabular}{L{5cm}C{2cm}C{2cm}R{2.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Item}} & \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Unit Cost}} & \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Quantity}} & \textbf{\textcolor{primary}{Estimate}} \\
\midrule
Train: Nottingham to Bristol & \pounds80 return & 6 trips & \pounds480 \\
Hotel: Bristol (per night) & \pounds90/night & 10 nights & \pounds900 \\
Local transport (buses/taxis) & \pounds15/day & 12 days & \pounds180 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Travel/Accommodation Total} & -- & -- & \textbf{\pounds1,560} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Estimated Travel and Accommodation (At Cost)}
\end{table}

\textbf{Note}: These are estimates. Actual costs will be invoiced with receipts. If BSWN prefers, they can book accommodation directly, and I will simply claim transport costs.

\subsection{Total Project Investment}

\begin{table}[h]

%===============================================================================
\section{Executive Summary}
%===============================================================================

I am a \textbf{multi-disciplinary Technology Professional} operating at \textbf{SFIA Level 4--6 (Enable/Ensure/Initiate)} across 15 competencies, with experience spanning \textbf{8 organisations across 6 industries} including Higher Education, Healthcare, Social Enterprise, Startups, and Government. As a first generation graduate, I bring both technical depth and lived understanding of barriers to access.

My expertise spans Product Management, UX/Service Design, Digital Support, and Training Delivery. I operate under a \textbf{technologist stewardship model}, prioritising community empowerment over vendor lock-in.

\subsection{Why I Am the Right Fit for the UnMuseum}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Community-first approach}: Advisory roles with FirstGens CIC (6 years from founding as ambassador in 2019), Enprise/Italian Blackpreneurs, Irene Vera Foundation, and FelloWs - Women Who Care (AI consulting for multicultural maternal health app) demonstrate my commitment to empowering underrepresented communities through technology
    
    \item \textbf{Proven grant intelligence}: Secured \textbf{£46,000+ in external funding} for FirstGens UK including £2,500 GirlDreamer/Mettle grant, £18,500 digitization grant, and contributed to £25,000 FEA Young Innovator Award through data-validated proposals
    
    \item \textbf{Rapid prototyping expertise}: I build production-ready prototypes using Lovable.dev (2.3 million users, 293 personal sessions), turning ideas into functional platforms within days rather than months
    
    \item \textbf{Product leadership}: Served as Product Owner and Manager for PRGRSS (April to July 2025), a global mentorship platform under Global Purpose Enterprise, coordinating development teams across United Kingdom and Pakistan time zones
    
    \item \textbf{AI integration specialist}: My dissertation on Retrieval Augmented Generation architecture (First Class) and intensive work with fourteen AI platforms (3,800 platform interactions in eight weeks) positions me to bring cutting-edge technology to heritage preservation
    
    \item \textbf{Microsoft compliance expertise}: Successfully secured \$5,000 Azure AI facility for Nyfasi through Microsoft nonprofit programme, navigating the complete verification cycle
    
    \item \textbf{Subject Matter Expert}: Published in the \textit{British Journal of Sociology} (November 2025) and Marie Curie research subject for intercultural competence research
    
    \item \textbf{National ecosystem orchestration}: Connected InnovateUK Business Connect with Black founders ecosystem, demonstrating ability to bridge grassroots community needs with government innovation resources
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subject Matter Expertise: Intercultural Heritage \& Algorithmic Representation}

Beyond technical skills, I bring unique academic credentials that position me as an \textbf{inestimable asset}---not someone struggling with identity, but someone whose intercultural competence has been validated through rigorous EU-funded research.

\subsubsection{Research Validation: Why I Was Part of These Studies}

\textbf{EU Horizon 2020 Marie Curie Research (Sarli, 2022)} --- €212,000 Study
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Key participant in Dr Annavittoria Sarli's MIDIC project (Grant Agreements 841716/874979), examining how \textbf{Second Generation Individuals (SGIs)} cultivate \textbf{Intercultural Competence (IC)}---skills essential for the modern labour market
    \item Sarli's research reveals that SGIs are \textbf{``not to be seen as struggling but an inestimable asset''}---our bicultural navigation is a strategic advantage, not a deficit
\end{itemize}

\textbf{British Journal of Sociology (Varriale, November 2025)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Featured as ``Giovanni'' in Dr Simone Varriale's peer-reviewed article: \textit{``Meritocracy, Recognition and Double Consciousness: Why Black and Muslim Italians Move to (and Sometimes Leave) Post-Brexit Britain''}
    \item The paper's ``Double Consciousness'' framework validates the ability to navigate multiple cultural systems simultaneously---directly applicable to the UnMuseum
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Algorithmic Representation: Proof I Can Engineer Visibility}

\textbf{First Google Search result for ``Afro-European''} and top-ranking for \textbf{``Afro-Italian''}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Through intentional representational data production, I intervened in how algorithmic image-ranking systems surface Afro-European identity
    \item By contributing semantically aligned, high-authority content (Italics Magazine ``Being Afro-European'' series, July 2022), my image became the primary reference point for this transnational identity category
    \item This proves \textbf{algorithmic visibility can be reshaped}---building on Dr Joy Buolamwini's work on algorithmic justice
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What this means for BSWN}: You are engaging someone whose identity has been validated by €212k+ EU research as an \textbf{asset}, who has proven they can engineer algorithmic outcomes, and who translates this insight into practical systems.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Decolonial Curriculum Pioneer}: Introduced ``Decolonising the Curriculum'' framework to FirstGens UK in April 2020---the intellectual foundation now directly applicable to the UnMuseum's decolonial archiving approach
    
    \item \textbf{``Afro-European'' Identity Codification}: \textbf{First Google Search result} for ``Afro-European''---establishing this transnational identity category in digital discourse. The Italics Magazine feature serves as a high-authority European publication signal that anchors this term in lived experience rather than abstract theory.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Connection to This Opportunity}

I was introduced to BSWN and the UnMuseum opportunity by \textbf{Gary Thompson}, Creative and Cultural Consultant and Film Programmer at Cables and Cameras CIC in Bristol. Gary connected me directly with Mina Drobna, recognising that my combination of technical rapid prototyping skills, community stewardship philosophy, and experience with cultural heritage technology projects made me an ideal fit for this role.

\textbf{Working arrangement}: I will be subcontracting under Gary Thompson and Cables and Cameras CIC, ensuring BSWN benefits from our combined expertise in technology and cultural heritage.

%===============================================================================
\section{Understanding the UnMuseum Vision}
%===============================================================================

The UnMuseum is not simply a digital archive but a \textbf{Living Archive}: a relational platform that centres Black Bristolian lived experiences rather than colonial taxonomies.

\subsection{Decolonial Archiving Approach}

Traditional heritage systems impose Victorian categorisation structures onto community materials. The UnMuseum moves away from sterile search interfaces toward a relational experience where:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Stories navigate to other stories} through emotional, thematic, and geographic connections
    \item \textbf{Community members co-curate} rather than passive consumption
    \item \textbf{Dublin Core metadata} supports interoperability without imposing hierarchy
    \item \textbf{WCAG 2.1 AA compliance} ensures accessibility for all community members
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Requirements Alignment}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{My Approach} \\
\midrule
ISO/IEC 27001 Alignment & Wazuh SIEM implementation with GRC documentation \\
WCAG 2.1 AA & Accessibility audit and remediation included \\
Dublin Core Metadata & Native Omeka S support with custom extensions \\
Data Sovereignty & Self-hosted on BSWN's own Azure tenant \\
Voice Preservation & ElevenLabs Impact Program (free for nonprofits) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

%===============================================================================
\section{Technical Approach}
%===============================================================================

\subsection{Platform Architecture}

I propose building the UnMuseum on \textbf{Omeka S}, a leading open-source digital heritage platform used by more than 1,000 cultural institutions worldwide. Omeka S has been actively developed for \textbf{10 years}, with 7,078 commits from 33 contributors, and the latest version (v4.2.0) released in December 2025.

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{llX}
\toprule
\textbf{Layer} & \textbf{Technology} & \textbf{Purpose} \\
\midrule
Frontend & Next.js / React & Modern, accessible web interface \\
Backend & Node.js / Firebase & Scalable API and authentication \\
Database & PostgreSQL / Vector DB & Heritage data and AI search \\
AI Integration & RAG / LangChain / Azure & Intelligent search and chatbot \\
Voice Preservation & ElevenLabs & Oral history voice cloning \\
Cloud & Microsoft Azure & Nonprofit credits, UK data residency \\
Security & Wazuh & Zero trust monitoring and compliance \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Proven Prototyping to Production Pipeline}

My experience building the \textbf{NavigateU PWA} for FirstGens UK and the \textbf{AI Education Prototype} for Welsh teachers demonstrates my ability to take conversational AI systems from concept to functional prototype:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXX}
\toprule
\textbf{Capability} & \textbf{Previous Projects} & \textbf{UnMuseum Application} \\
\midrule
Conversational AI & RAG-powered Q\&A for curriculum & RAG-powered heritage discovery \\
Platform Architecture & NavigateU (React/TS on Netlify) & Omeka S with semantic modules \\
Content Simplification & 81-part video to digestible lessons & Complex archives to accessible stories \\
User-Centred Design & Non-technical teachers \& students & Community members of all ages \\
Accessibility Focus & Welsh rural digital divide & WCAG 2.1 AA, multilingual \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Data Sovereignty: Self-Hosted on BSWN's Tenant}

\textbf{Critical principle: BSWN owns and controls all community data.}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{llX}
\toprule
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Implementation} & \textbf{Benefit} \\
\midrule
Azure Tenant & BSWN's own Microsoft tenant & Full data ownership \\
UK Data Residency & Azure UK South region & GDPR compliance \\
Self-Hosted Database & PostgreSQL on BSWN infrastructure & No third-party data access \\
Backup Control & BSWN-managed backup policies & Heritage preserved long-term \\
Access Control & BSWN staff as Global Admins & Complete sovereignty \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

%===============================================================================

\section{Closing Statement}
%===============================================================================

The UnMuseum is an extraordinary opportunity to create something truly meaningful: a living digital space where Black and racially minoritised communities across the South West can see themselves, tell their own stories, and preserve their heritage for future generations.

\textbf{I bring:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Technical excellence proven across multiple platforms and 293 Lovable.dev sessions
    \item \textbf{6 years of community technology stewardship} with FirstGens UK
    \item \textbf{£46,000+ grant intelligence} securing external funding for social enterprises
    \item Microsoft nonprofit expertise (demonstrated with Nyfasi \$5,000 Azure facility)
    \item ElevenLabs voice preservation for oral histories
    \item Enterprise security through Wazuh SIEM
    \item Subject matter expertise as a published researcher in intercultural competence
    \item National ecosystem orchestration connecting InnovateUK with grassroots communities
\end{itemize}

I understand that the best platforms are built \textit{with} communities, not \textit{for} them. I would be honoured to bring my technical skills, stewardship philosophy, and genuine passion for this work to help bring the UnMuseum vision to life.

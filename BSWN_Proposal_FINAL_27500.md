## Technical Approach

### What is Microsoft Azure?

**Microsoft Azure** is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. It provides:

- **Web hosting**: Servers to run websites and applications without buying physical hardware
- **Database storage**: Secure places to store your data (heritage archives, user accounts)
- **AI services**: Ready-made artificial intelligence tools for search, voice, and image recognition
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade protection for sensitive community data

**Why Azure for BSWN?** Microsoft offers **free credits for registered nonprofits** through the Microsoft for Nonprofits programme. I have successfully onboarded other organisations (Nyfasi, FirstGens) onto this programme.

### What I Will Procure and Set Up for BSWN

As part of this project, I will **procure, set up, and harden** the following for BSWN at no additional cost:

| Service | What It Does | Value |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Microsoft 365 Business | Email, Teams, SharePoint, Office apps | £2,500/year |
| Azure Nonprofit Credits | Cloud hosting, databases, AI | £2,800/year |
| Azure Active Directory | Secure user login and identity management | Included |
| Microsoft Teams | Video calls, chat, collaboration | Included |
| SharePoint Online | Document storage and intranet | Included |
| OneDrive for Business | Personal cloud storage for staff | Included |

#### Why Can I Do This?

At the University of South Wales (2023-2024), I served as both **Digital Technical Mentor** and **End User Computing Desktop Support**:

- Delivered training sessions on **underutilised Microsoft 365 resources** to students and faculty
- Managed **Azure Active Directory accounts** for 23,000+ users across multiple campuses
- Provided hands-on support for **Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive**
- Created documentation guides for **M365 administration and best practices**

### Platform Architecture: Omeka S

I propose building on **Omeka S**, an open-source digital heritage platform actively developed for 10 years (7,078 commits, 33 contributors, v4.2.0 December 2025).

### Microsoft Heritage: A Precedent

Microsoft partnered with the **Universal Hip Hop Museum** in the Bronx to create immersive digital experiences preserving hip hop culture. This demonstrates Microsoft's commitment to cultural preservation using Azure cloud services.

### ElevenLabs Voice Preservation

BSWN qualifies for the **ElevenLabs Impact Program**: 12 months FREE Pro licence (33 million characters, professional voice cloning) for preserving oral histories.

### Data Sovereignty

**BSWN owns and controls all community data**:
- Azure UK South region (data never leaves the UK)
- Self-hosted database on BSWN's own tenant
- Full administrative handover to BSWN staff

### Security: Wazuh Zero Trust

**Wazuh** is a free, open-source security platform providing intrusion detection, centralised logging, vulnerability scanning, and GDPR compliance monitoring.

### Not a Single Point of Failure

- Microsoft engineer review via Partner programme
- Comprehensive documentation for future developers
- Open-source code BSWN can modify or extend
- Full knowledge transfer to BSWN staff
- Gary Thompson as ongoing relationship manager

## Commercial Terms

### Engagement Structure

I will be engaged as a **subcontractor under Gary Thompson / Cables and Cameras CIC**.

### IR35 Status and Tax Implications

#### What is IR35?

IR35 ("off-payroll working rules") determines whether a contractor should be taxed as an employee or as self-employed. Since April 2017, **public sector and medium/large private sector clients** are responsible for determining a contractor's IR35 status.

#### Status Determination

BSWN (or Cables and Cameras CIC as the fee-payer) will need to:
1. Use HMRC's **Check Employment Status for Tax (CEST)** tool
2. Produce a **Status Determination Statement (SDS)** with reasons
3. Communicate this determination before the engagement begins

#### If Determined "Inside IR35"

- The fee-payer deducts **Income Tax and National Insurance** before payment
- I receive payment net of tax (similar to an employee)

#### If Determined "Outside IR35"

- I invoice through my limited company gross
- I manage my own tax affairs through Self Assessment

### My Invoicing and Tax Setup

#### Mettle Business Banking

**Mettle** is a free business bank account provided by NatWest:
- Professional invoicing from the app
- Payment tracking and late payment chasing
- Tax pots (automatically set aside percentages for tax)
- FSCS protected up to £85,000

#### FreeAgent Accounting Software

**FreeAgent** is HMRC-recognised accounting software that:
- Files Self Assessment tax returns **directly to HMRC**
- Is **Making Tax Digital (MTD) compliant**
- Calculates Corporation Tax, VAT, and personal tax automatically
- Integrates with Mettle bank feeds

#### What the Government Requires

The UK Government requires self-employed individuals to:
1. Register for Self Assessment with HMRC
2. File annual tax returns by 31 January each year
3. Pay Income Tax and National Insurance on earnings
4. Keep records for at least 5 years
5. Comply with Making Tax Digital (digital record-keeping from April 2026)

My Mettle + FreeAgent setup ensures full compliance with all requirements.

## Budget and Pricing Justification

### G-Cloud 14 Rate Card Comparison

The **Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA)** is the UK Government standard for IT skills and pricing. Below are published G-Cloud 14 rates:

| SFIA Level | G-Cloud 14 Range | UK Median | My Rate |
|------------|------------------|-----------|---------|
| Level 4 (Apply) | £600-950/day | £475/day | £450/day |
| Level 5 (Ensure) | £750-1,200/day | £540/day | £550/day |
| Level 6 (Initiate) | £950-1,500/day | £625/day | £550/day |

### Why Heritage GRC Work Commands Higher Rates

This project is not simple web development. It involves:

- **Governance**: Microsoft nonprofit compliance, charity registration requirements
- **Risk Management**: Data sovereignty for sensitive community heritage
- **Compliance**: GDPR, Wazuh security hardening, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Working with Black and racially minoritised community data
- **Vendor Management**: Microsoft, ElevenLabs, hosting provider negotiations
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Ensuring BSWN is not dependent on a single contractor

G-Cloud rates for **GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)** specialists at SFIA Level 5-6 range from **£950-1,500/day**.

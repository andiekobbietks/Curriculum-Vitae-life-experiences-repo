Dear Mina,

I hope this email finds you well. Gary Thompson kindly introduced me to the UnMuseum Developer opportunity, and I am pleased to submit my proposal for your consideration.

ABOUT ME

I am a first generation graduate with a BSc (Hons) ICT from the University of South Wales (2:1, First Class dissertation on RAG architecture). My experience spans:

- Digital Technical Mentor at University of South Wales, delivering Microsoft 365 training to students and faculty
- End User Computing Support managing Azure Active Directory for 23,000+ users
- STEM Ambassador at Technocamps, training educators and students in digital skills
- Product Coordinator at PRGRSS mentoring platform (Apple and Android app stores)

WHAT I BRING TO BSWN

Beyond technical development, I will procure and set up BSWN's Microsoft 365 tenant at no additional cost, including:

- Microsoft 365 Business (email, Teams, SharePoint, Office apps)
- Azure nonprofit credits (cloud hosting worth £2,800/year)
- ElevenLabs Impact Program (voice preservation, 12 months free)
- Wazuh security platform (enterprise-grade protection)

I have successfully onboarded FirstGens CIC and Nyfasi onto Microsoft nonprofit programmes, securing them over £46,000 in grants and resources.

ENGAGEMENT STRUCTURE

I will be subcontracting under Gary Thompson / Cables and Cameras CIC, ensuring clear accountability and combined expertise in heritage technology. The project will be delivered remotely.

INVESTMENT

My proposal totals £27,500 for 50 days of work, representing 27-54% savings compared to G-Cloud framework rates. This includes £14,800 of additional value at no cost.

# Oprah Funding Strategy & Vision
## Executive Summary: The "Sovereign Node"
**Vision:** Oprah Manyika aims to build a "Sovereign Node" for Neurodiversity bridging the UK and Zimbabwe. This is not just a charity; it is a scalable infrastructure providing educational access and neurodivergent support (ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia) across borders.
**Your Role:** You are the Technical Steward/Architect, building the digital infrastructure to handle institutional funding (e.g., the £350k BSWN bid).

## Funding Landscape Analysis
**User Context:** You have "made FirstGens money" (Secured £46k). This moves you from "Risky Startup" to "Proven Operator."

### Tier 1: High-Fit "Infrastructure" & "Job Creation"
*   **Mastercard Foundation "Africa Works":** Funds ecosystems that train youth (30M jobs by 2030). Fits your "Software-Defined Training Provider" model.
*   **Innovate UK (GCRF/KTP):** Partnerships between UK (IVF UK) and Developing Country (IVF Zim). Good for "AI-driven neurodiversity support" research.
*   **Digital Transformation Center (DTC) Ghana (GIZ):** German-funded. Focuses on local digital skills.
*   **BSWN (Black South West Network):** The £350k bid you are targeting. This is the "Base Camp" funding.

### Tier 2: Entrepreneurship & Seed Capital
*   **Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF):** $5,000 seed capital. Good for operational costs/salary.
*   **Ghana Innovation Hub:** Incubation for EdTech.
*   **Google for Startups Accelerator Africa:** Equity-free support + Cloud Credits. Leveraging your "Neurodiversity in Africa" data is the hook.

### Tier 3: Strategic/Niche
*   **Sovereign Tech Fund:** For "Open Source Infrastructure" critical to public interest.
*   **Sovereign Node Strategy:** If you open-source the platform, this is a strong contender.

## Addendum: The FirstGens Precedent
**Evidence of Financial Stewardship:**
Before Irene Vera Foundation, the Technical Steward (Andie) served as Board Advisor for **FirstGens UK**.
*   **Achievement:** Successfully architected the technical strategy that secured **£46,000** in grant funding.
*   **Relevance:** We are replicating this winning formula. We are not guessing; we are proven operators.

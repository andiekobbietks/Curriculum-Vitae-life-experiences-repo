## 1. Executive Summary

I am a first gen graduate and IT professional with deep expertise in web development, cloud infrastructure, and artificial intelligence solutions. My background uniquely combines technical proficiency with meaningful community engagement work, particularly with organisations supporting Black and racially minoritised communities.

**Why I am the right fit for the UnMuseum:**

- **Community-first approach**: Advisory roles with FirstGens CIC, Enprise/Italian Blackpreneurs, Irene Vera Foundation, and Di FELLOWS demonstrate my commitment to empowering underrepresented communities through technology
- **Rapid prototyping expertise**: I build production-ready prototypes using Lovable.dev (2.3 million users, £79 million annual recurring revenue), turning ideas into functional platforms within days rather than months
- **Product leadership**: Served as Product Owner and Manager for PRGRSS (April to July 2025), a global mentorship platform under Global Purpose Enterprise, coordinating development teams across United Kingdom and Pakistan time zones
- **AI integration specialist**: My dissertation on Retrieval Augmented Generation architecture (First Class) and intensive work with fourteen AI platforms (3,800 platform interactions in eight weeks) positions me to bring cutting-edge technology to heritage preservation
- **SFIA-aligned competencies**: Operating at SFIA Level 4 (Enable) with progression towards Level 5, demonstrated through autonomous project delivery, cross-functional team coordination, and technical decision-making
- **Technologist stewardship model**: I work as a technology steward, not extracting maximum profit, but ensuring organisations build sustainable digital capacity and ownership
- **Microsoft compliance expertise**: Successfully secured $5,000 Azure AI facility for Nyfasi through Microsoft nonprofit programme, navigating the complete verification cycle

The UnMuseum is not merely a technical build. It is a platform for resistance, care, and imagination. I approach this work with genuine cultural understanding and technical excellence.

**Connection to this opportunity**: I was introduced to BSWN and the UnMuseum opportunity by Gary Thompson, Creative and Cultural Consultant and Film Programmer at Cables and Cameras CIC in Bristol. Gary connected me directly with Mina Drobna, recognising that my combination of technical rapid prototyping skills, community stewardship philosophy, and experience with cultural heritage technology projects made me an ideal fit for this role.

## 2. Technologist Stewardship Model

### My Philosophy: Building Capacity, Not Dependency

I operate as a technology steward rather than a traditional consultant. This means:

| Traditional Consultant | Technology Steward (My Approach) |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Maximises billable hours | Focuses on knowledge transfer and capacity building |
| Creates dependency on external expertise | Empowers organisations to manage their own technology |
| Proprietary solutions that create vendor lock-in | Open-source, community-owned platforms |
| Profit-driven engagement | Mission-aligned partnership |
| Leaves when budget ends | Builds sustainable systems that outlast the engagement |

**What This Means for BSWN:**
- **Full ownership**: You own all code, data, and systems with no lock-in
- **Training included**: Staff trained to manage the platform independently
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides so future developers can maintain and extend the platform
- **Community-centred**: Technology decisions driven by community needs, not vendor interests
- **Transparent pricing**: No hidden costs or surprise fees

### Evidence of Stewardship in Practice

| Organisation | Stewardship Provided | Outcome |
|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| **PRGRSS/GPE** | Built prototypes, trained team, created documentation | Pakistan development team can now build independently |
| **FirstGens CIC** | Pro-bono technical advisory, connected to funding | Sustainable digital presence |
| **Irene Vera Foundation** | Building website pro-bono, training on accessibility | Charity gaining digital capacity |
| **Di FELLOWS** | Free AI education, shared resources, built prototype | Founder can now evaluate AI solutions independently |
| **Enprise/Italian Blackpreneurs** | Shared AI tools, growth strategies, no fees | Network equipped with modern tools |
| **Nyfasi** | Microsoft nonprofit onboarding, $5,000 Azure AI facility secured | Organisation now has Microsoft Partner status |

## 3. Lovable.dev: Rapid Prototyping for Community Organisations

### What is Lovable.dev?

Lovable.dev is a revolutionary AI-powered platform that enables rapid application development through natural language, turning ideas into production-ready software in hours rather than months.

**Platform Facts:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Launched** | November 2024 (rebranded from GPT Engineer) |
| **Founded** | 2023 in Stockholm, Sweden by Anton Osika (CEO) and Fabian Hedin (CTO) |
| **Active Users** | 2.3 million |
| **Paying Subscribers** | 180,000 |
| **Applications Built** | More than 10 million |
| **Annual Recurring Revenue Growth** | Zero to £79 million in eight months |
| **Daily New Projects** | More than 100,000 |
| **Technology** | React, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL), Tailwind CSS |

**Sources:** Lovable (2025); TechCrunch (2024)

### Who Uses Lovable.dev?

- Startup founders building minimum viable products to validate ideas quickly
- Designers converting Figma designs to live applications
- Business analysts automating workflows
- Students launching side-businesses
- Enterprise innovation teams at Klarna and HubSpot for hackathons
- Community organisations (such as PRGRSS) prototyping features before expensive development

### Why I Use Lovable.dev (Based on My Usage Pattern)

From my 293 Lovable.dev sessions building five production prototypes:

1. **Speed**: Ideas become clickable prototypes in hours, enabling true co-design with communities
2. **Visual Communication**: Non-technical stakeholders can see and interact with features before committing development resources
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Test ten ideas for the cost of building one traditionally
4. **Production-Ready Code**: Output is clean React and TypeScript that developers can extend
5. **Full Ownership**: Export to GitHub with no vendor lock-in

### How I Used Lovable.dev at PRGRSS

**Challenge**: Coordinating feature development between United Kingdom product team and Pakistan developers across five-hour time zone difference. Traditional documentation led to misunderstandings and rework.

**Solution**: Built interactive prototypes in Lovable.dev that developers could experience directly.

| Prototype | URL | Result |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| PRGRSS Mentor Connect | [prgrss-mentor-connect.lovable.app](https://prgrss-mentor-connect.lovable.app/) | Aligned team vision in one session versus weeks of documents |
| PRGRSS Mentor Connect V2 | [prgrss-mentor-connect-02.lovable.app](https://prgrss-mentor-connect-02.lovable.app/) | Pakistan team built feature three times faster with visual reference |
| PRGRSS Admin Dashboard | [prgrss-admin-dashboard-ui-47.lovable.app/jobs](https://prgrss-admin-dashboard-ui-47.lovable.app/jobs) | Reduced revision cycles by 60 per cent |
| Mentor Dynamic Directory | [mentor-dynamic-directory.lovable.app](https://mentor-dynamic-directory.lovable.app/) | Community feedback collected before development |

**Outcome**: Development velocity increased significantly. Features shipped with fewer revisions. Cross-timezone communication transformed from frustrating to productive.

### How I Will Use Lovable.dev for UnMuseum

- I will build interactive prototypes within the first two weeks of discovery
- Community members can click through and experience the platform before any code is written
- Reduces risk of building something that does not meet community needs
- Enables genuine co-design with non-technical stakeholders

---

## 5. Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) Services

### My GRC Approach

Beyond development, I provide GRC advisory to ensure the UnMuseum digital infrastructure is secure, compliant, and sustainable.

**GRC Services for BSWN/UnMuseum:**

| Service | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Data Protection Compliance** | GDPR/UK DPA 2018 audit, privacy policies, consent mechanisms | Protects community data, avoids fines |
| **Accessibility Compliance** | WCAG 2.1 AA audit, remediation, ongoing monitoring | Ensures platform is usable by all |
| **Security Assessment** | Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, security policies | Protects heritage content from threats |
| **AI Ethics Framework** | Responsible AI use policy, bias monitoring, transparency | Ensures AI serves community values |
| **Business Continuity** | Backup strategy, disaster recovery, data retention policies | Heritage preserved for generations |
| **Funding Compliance** | NLHF reporting frameworks, audit trails, impact documentation | Demonstrates value to funders |

## 6. Microsoft Heritage: What It Means for BSWN

### Understanding Microsoft AI for Cultural Heritage

"Microsoft Heritage" refers to accessing Microsoft's AI for Cultural Heritage track and preservation initiatives within their AI for Good programme. This is significant because BSWN, as a registered charity, qualifies for substantial technology grants and support.

### What BSWN Gains Through My Facilitation

| Benefit | Description | Annual Value |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Azure Nonprofit Credits** | Cloud hosting, databases, AI services via TechSoup | £2,000 to £2,800 per year |
| **Microsoft 365 Business Basic** | Email, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive (10 seats free) | £1,200 per year |
| **AI for Cultural Heritage Toolkit** | Access to preservation technologies | Included |
| **Case Study Recognition** | Potential feature in Microsoft heritage portfolio | Visibility |
| **Technical Support** | Priority access to Microsoft heritage specialists | Included |
| **Partner Network** | Connection to other heritage organisations using Microsoft | Knowledge sharing |

**Total Estimated Annual Value: £5,000 to £10,000**

### The Universal Hip Hop Museum Precedent

Microsoft partnered with the Universal Hip Hop Museum in the Bronx to create an AI-powered interactive archive preserving hip-hop cultural history (Microsoft, 2019). The partnership delivered:

- AI-powered collection discovery and semantic search
- Interactive timeline visualisation of hip-hop history
- Global accessibility through cloud infrastructure
- Recognition as a Microsoft AI for Good case study

**I will position UnMuseum for identical recognition and support.**

### My Track Record with Microsoft Nonprofit

I have direct experience securing Microsoft nonprofit resources. For Nyfasi (Afro-Caribbean health technology company), I:

- Navigated Microsoft's nonprofit verification process including DUNS number registration
- Secured $5,000 (approximately £4,000) Azure AI facility for their platform
- Configured compliance controls and cost management
- Set up GRC frameworks for responsible AI use

**Corporate consultancies such as Accenture and Deloitte charge £10,000 or more for this onboarding alone.** I include it as part of my stewardship commitment.

### Why BSWN Cannot Access This Alone

BSWN's current digital presence is on Squarespace. Accessing Microsoft nonprofit grants requires:

1. TechSoup validation (UK Charity Commission number plus governance documentation)
2. Azure tenant setup with Enterprise Application configuration
3. Role-Based Access Control for multiple roles
4. Billing alignment mapping TechSoup tokens to Azure subscription
5. Security baseline with Azure Defender activation
6. Grant reporting with monthly usage reconciliation
7. AI for Good Lab nomination requiring ten-page technical proposal

**No member of the BSWN team has the specialist knowledge to navigate this process.** This is information asymmetry that I bridge for community organisations.

## 13. Why Me?

1. **Technical Excellence**: Full-stack development, cloud infrastructure (AWS certified), AI integration (1,491 AI Studio sessions), rapid prototyping with Lovable.dev

2. **Stewardship, Not Extraction**: I build organisations' capacity to own and manage their technology, not dependency on expensive consultants

3. **Community-Centred**: My work with FirstGens, Enprise, Di FELLOWS, PRGRSS, and Irene Vera Foundation demonstrates commitment to building technology that empowers marginalised communities

4. **Proven Delivery**: Led PRGRSS product development using Lovable.dev to accelerate development three times and reduce miscommunication 60 per cent

5. **GRC Expertise**: I ensure UnMuseum is compliant, secure, and sustainable, not just functional

6. **Microsoft Nonprofit Expertise**: I have already secured $5,000 Azure AI facility for Nyfasi, demonstrating I can navigate the complex Microsoft nonprofit process

7. **Rapid Prototyping**: Using Lovable.dev, BSWN will see working prototypes within two weeks, enabling genuine co-design with community members before expensive development

8. **Intercultural Competence**: Academic recognition of my understanding of diasporic identity and community-centred technology

## 14. Closing Statement

The UnMuseum is an extraordinary opportunity to create something truly meaningful: a living digital space where Black and racially minoritised communities across the South West can see themselves, tell their own stories, and preserve their heritage for future generations.

As a technology steward, I do not just build platforms. I build organisations' capacity to own and sustain their digital futures. I will:

- **Prototype rapidly** so the community shapes the platform from day one
- **Onboard BSWN onto Microsoft nonprofit programmes** for £2,800 per year in ongoing value
- **Ensure GRC compliance** so the platform is secure, accessible, and sustainable
- **Transfer knowledge** so BSWN staff can manage the platform independently
- **Remain committed** throughout your NLHF funding period and beyond
- **Build with care** because this work matters beyond any contract

I understand that the best platforms are built with communities, not for them. I would be honoured to bring my technical skills, stewardship philosophy, and genuine passion for this work to help bring the UnMuseum vision to life.

**Let us build something powerful together.**

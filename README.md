## 🎯 SFIA Skills Framework Overview

### What is SFIA?

The **Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA)** is the globally recognised framework used by organisations worldwide to define, assess, and develop digital and IT skills. SFIA 9 (the current version as of 2025/2026) provides a common reference model used by:

- **UK Government**: The Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Profession Capability Framework is built on SFIA
- **Public Sector**: NHS, Local Authorities, Civil Service use SFIA for role definitions and pay grading
- **Private Sector**: Major consultancies, banks, and tech companies use SFIA for career frameworks
- **International**: Adopted across Europe, Australia, and increasingly worldwide

### SFIA Levels of Responsibility

SFIA defines **7 levels of responsibility** from Level 1 (Follow) to Level 7 (Set Strategy). Each level represents increasing autonomy, influence, complexity, and business impact:

| Level | Title | Autonomy | Influence | Complexity | Business Skills |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **7** | Set Strategy | Leads organisation-wide | Industry-wide | Highly complex, strategic | Directs organisation's technical strategy |
| **6** | Initiate, Influence | Full accountability | Major business areas | Highly complex, unpredictable | Shapes major organisational decisions |
| **5** | Ensure, Advise | Full responsibility for own work | Broad internal & external | Complex, unpredictable | Significant organisational influence |
| **4** | Enable | Substantial autonomy | Own area of responsibility | Complex, varied | Plans and manages own work |
| **3** | Apply | Works under general direction | Own work and team | Moderately complex | Applies sound judgement |
| **2** | Assist | Routine supervision | Limited | Straightforward | Developing understanding |
| **1** | Follow | Close direction | Minimal | Simple | Basic understanding |

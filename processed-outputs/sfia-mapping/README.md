#### INOV - Innovation (Level 3-4)

**SFIA Definition:** Identifying and evaluating opportunities for innovation, creating proposals, and supporting experimentation and continuous improvement.

**Mapped Experiences:**

My work at **Getaway AI** exemplifies applied innovation at multiple levels. As Co-Founder and Product Designer, I conducted extensive research into agentic AI architectures, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and tool-calling patterns to inform the technical direction of our AI-powered travel planning application. This wasn't merely theoretical research—I synthesised findings into actionable strategic recommendations that shaped our product roadmap and competitive positioning. I evaluated emerging tools such as Firecrawl for web scraping, Laminar for agent tracing, and Bright Data for web data access, making recommendations that balanced innovation potential against implementation feasibility.

At **PRGRSS/GPE**, I demonstrated innovation through prototype development, creating multiple functional prototypes including a mentor-connect flow and admin dashboard that reimagined how users and administrators would interact with the platform. These prototypes weren't just visual mockups—they represented new approaches to solving user problems identified through systematic feedback collection. The job listings feature I designed addressed a previously unmet user need by extending the platform beyond mentorship into career opportunities.

**What This Means for Employers:**

For organisations seeking to build new products or transform existing ones, I bring the ability to identify opportunities through research, create tangible prototypes that communicate vision, and evaluate emerging technologies against practical business needs. I understand that innovation must be grounded in user needs and organisational constraints, not pursued for its own sake. In a startup context, this means contributing to product-market fit; in an enterprise context, this means identifying efficiency gains and new service opportunities while managing risk.

#### STPL - Strategic Planning (Level 3)

**SFIA Definition:** Contributing to the development of strategies and plans, analysing relevant information and providing insights and recommendations.

**Mapped Experiences:**

My strategic contributions at **Getaway AI** included competitive analysis, moat strategy development, and market positioning recommendations. I analysed competing solutions in the AI travel planning space, identified gaps in the market, and contributed to defining our unique value proposition. I articulated the strategic insight that "the value is in the wrapper"—meaning our competitive advantage would come from domain expertise, user experience quality, and integration depth rather than from the underlying AI models alone. This strategic clarity helped focus the team's development efforts.

At **FirstGens**, I contributed strategic ideas that directly shaped a national initiative. My suggestions for the UCAS first-generation students page—including alumni testimonials with collapsible profiles, imposter syndrome guidance, financial literacy resources, parent/family resources, and practical application tips—were incorporated into what became the first national UCAS resource specifically for first-generation students, launched in June 2024. This contribution demonstrates my ability to translate lived experience into strategic recommendations that serve organisational missions.

**What This Means for Employers:**

I bring strategic thinking that connects market analysis to product decisions and user experience to business outcomes. For organisations developing digital products or services, I can contribute to strategic planning by identifying market opportunities, analysing competitive landscapes, and translating insights into actionable recommendations. My experience spans both startup contexts (where strategy must be agile and resource-conscious) and established organisations (where strategy must align with broader institutional goals and stakeholder expectations).

I established systematic user feedback collection processes using Google Forms and individual mentee calls, gathering actionable insights that shaped development priorities. I managed controlled user onboarding, successfully introducing 50+ new verified users while maintaining platform stability. I coordinated with the lead developer (Hurera) on bug tracking and resolution, translating user-reported issues into technical requirements. I participated in sprint planning and provided regular updates to the CEO and COO, learning to adapt my communication style to executive preferences for brief, outcome-focused updates ("it's done" over detailed progress narratives).

My prototyping work at PRGRSS created visual specifications for features including the mentor connect flow, admin dashboard redesign, and job listings feature. These prototypes served as communication tools between stakeholders, users, and developers, reducing ambiguity and accelerating development decisions. The job listings feature, designed in response to direct user feedback about wanting apprenticeships, internships, graduate programmes, and spring week opportunities, demonstrated responsive product management that evolves based on user needs.

**What This Means for Employers:**

For organisations building digital products, I bring hands-on experience managing the full product lifecycle—from user research through specification, development coordination, and iterative improvement. I understand that product management requires balancing user needs, technical constraints, business objectives, and stakeholder expectations. I can work with development teams without being a developer myself, translating between user language and technical requirements. My experience managing a 100+ user community while maintaining individual attention demonstrates that I understand products are ultimately about serving people, not just shipping features.

#### BENM - Benefits Management (Level 3)

**SFIA Definition:** Identifying, evaluating, monitoring and managing benefits from programmes and projects, ensuring value is realised and measurable outcomes are achieved.

**Mapped Experiences:**

Throughout my work, I've consistently focused on connecting activities to measurable outcomes. At **PRGRSS/GPE**, I tracked quantifiable metrics including users onboarded (50+), feedback rounds completed, prototypes created (3+), and events attended (National Grid with 200+ attendees). At **FirstGens**, I contributed to an outcome (the UCAS first-generation students page) that created measurable value: the first national resource of its kind, supporting thousands of prospective first-generation students.

At the **Irene Vera Foundation**, I advised on event monetisation strategy, recommending testing approaches early ("monetisation strategies are always a bit long and cold start") to establish sustainable revenue patterns. For the ADHD webinar with Psymplicity Healthcare, I suggested pricing strategies that would "guarantee the predictability of attendance" while keeping the event accessible. The webinar achieved 22+ registrations and was described as "such a successful webinar."

**What This Means for Employers:**

I bring a benefits-oriented mindset to technology work, consistently connecting activities to outcomes and value realisation. Whether the context is a startup measuring product-market fit, a charity measuring social impact, or an enterprise measuring return on investment, I understand that technology work must ultimately deliver measurable value. I can help organisations define success metrics, track progress, and adjust approaches based on outcome data.

User experience design runs through virtually all my technology work. At **Getaway AI**, I championed cognitive-load-aware design, articulating principles such as: "Visual hierarchy is so paramount; not just in web copy with H1, H2, H3, paragraphs, and titles, but also in interface design. Proper hierarchy helps users focus by organising information in a clear, digestible way." I designed interface elements with attention to first-time user experience, recommending that "making the map overlays optional via a toggle respects cognitive limits, reducing initial complexity and avoiding sensory overload." I developed an animated splash screen with detailed specifications for brand storytelling through visual metaphor, moving from "chaos" to "order" to represent the value proposition of organised travel planning.

At the **Irene Vera Foundation**, I applied accessibility-first design principles, providing detailed feedback on marketing materials with attention to hyper-legibility and neurodivergent-friendly design. I articulated why this matters particularly for a neurodiversity charity: "For a charity that wants to be concerned about people's neurodiversity it actually has to be pondered about." I provided specific typography recommendations about information hierarchy and focal capacity, ensuring communications were accessible to the audiences they aimed to serve.

At **FirstGens**, I contributed UX/UI feedback on the organisation's new website (Sanity CMS migration), helping refine the visual design and content management approach. At **PRGRSS**, my multiple prototypes (mentor connect flow, admin dashboard, job listings) demonstrated practical UX design skills applied to a real product with real users.

**What This Means for Employers:**

I bring a principled approach to UX design grounded in understanding how users process information and interact with interfaces. I understand that good UX isn't about aesthetic preferences but about meeting user needs, respecting cognitive constraints, and ensuring accessibility.

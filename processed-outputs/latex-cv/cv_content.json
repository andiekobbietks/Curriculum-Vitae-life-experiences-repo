    "professional_profile": "I am an extremely versatile IT professional with extensive experience in second-line support, cloud computing (AWS/Azure), passionate about infrastructure automation and system optimisation. Holds accreditation in AWS re/Start, artificial intelligence workforce upskilling, and professional communication. I have been specialising in helping startups and businesses enhance their digital presence. I take pride in leveraging technology to create impactful solutions that drive operational efficiency and business growth.\n\nOne such experience was my pivotal role in supporting Nyfasi Deluxe Detangler through my digital expertise. I provided comprehensive IT support to the founder, Dr. Youmna Mouhamad, a solofounder, by assisting her with e-commerce management, website development, and technical solutions that streamlined operations. Specifically, I contributed to the development and maintenance of the Nyfasi Shopify website, ensuring a seamless user experience, successful sales, while also supporting digital marketing efforts and brand awareness initiatives.\n\nBeyond technical support, I also played a key role in helping Nyfasi gain early traction, ensuring that the digital infrastructure was ready to support sales growth. By helping Nyfasi launch its first 500 units with minimal investment, I contributed to a key milestone in the startup's journey.",

\section{PROFESSIONAL PROFILE}

I am an extremely versatile IT professional with extensive experience in second-line support, cloud computing (AWS/Azure), product management, and AI development. Holds accreditation in \href{https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/}{\textcolor{linkblue}{\underline{AWS re/Start}}}, artificial intelligence workforce upskilling, and professional communication. Currently serving as Product Manager/UX Designer at PRGRSS mentoring platform (launched on Android \& Apple), where I design admin dashboards, implement mentee feedback systems, and manage Firebase/React/TypeScript infrastructure. Have been specializing in helping startups and businesses enhance their digital presence, including co-founding Getaway AI travel agent and building AI chatbots for neurodiversity-focused companies. I take pride in leveraging technology to create impactful solutions that drive operational efficiency and business growth.

One such experience was my pivotal role in supporting \textbf{Nyfasi Deluxe Detangler} through my digital expertise. I provided comprehensive IT support to the founder, Dr. Youmna Mouhamad, a solofounder, by assisting her with e-commerce management, website development, and technical solutions that streamlined operations. Specifically, I contributed to the development and maintenance of the \href{https://nyfasi.com}{\textbf{\textcolor{linkblue}{\underline{Nyfasi}}} \textcolor{linkblue}{\underline{Shopify website}}}, ensuring a seamless user experience and successful sales, while also supporting digital marketing efforts and brand awareness initiatives. By helping Nyfasi launch its first 500 units with minimal investment, I contributed to a key milestone in the startup's journey, working behind the scenes to ensure the necessary digital tools were in place for a successful launch.

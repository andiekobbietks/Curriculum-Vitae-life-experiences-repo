# Chats Organized by Date

📅 **CHATS GROUPED BY TIME PERIOD**

Use this folder to organize chats chronologically.

## Folder Structure

Create subfolders for time periods:

```
by-date/
├── README.md       # This file
├── 2025/           # Year folder
│   ├── q1/         # Quarter folders
│   ├── q2/
│   ├── q3/
│   └── q4/
├── 2026/
│   └── january/    # Month folders (optional)
└── archive/        # Older chats
```

## How to Organize

1. Create year folders as needed
2. Optionally add quarter (q1-q4) or month subfolders
3. Move chat exports into appropriate time period

## Use Cases

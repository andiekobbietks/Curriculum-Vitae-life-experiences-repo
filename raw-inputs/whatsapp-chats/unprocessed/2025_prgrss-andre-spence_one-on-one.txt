[14/05/2025, 18:22:04] Andie: Sir apologise I think, ive had quite a heavy day with lots of context switch so im reading wrongly things, it all makes sense now and will be able to sort this out
[14/05/2025, 18:22:20] Andie: I'll speak to you tomorrow about ahead of my other meetings with the guys
[14/05/2025, 18:22:24] André (PRGRSS Boss) Spence: The mentor for you
[14/05/2025, 18:22:39] Andie: I am with you now, no thanks
[16/05/2025, 15:32:10] André (PRGRSS Boss) Spence: Hey sis — could you do me a favour?
Could you rework your testimony to make it more about the PRGRSS app? Even if you haven’t been on the platform yet, you can say you’re excited about what it offers and link your mentorship experience to the organisation. The goal is to help corporates understand the value, so mention things like confidence, guidance, support, and how it helped you in your career journey.

Here’s a structure you can follow:

⸻

Hi, my name is [First Name], and I’m currently a [student / graduate / aspiring professional] passionate about [industry or career focus].
	•	I’ve heard so much about the PRGRSS app, and I’m genuinely excited about what it’s doing for young people like me.
	•	Thanks to this organisation, I’ve been connected with incredible mentors who helped guide me through tough decisions, grow my confidence, and sharpen my professional mindset.
	•	The platform is all about bridging the gap between generations, and that’s something I’ve really benefited from — understanding how to navigate the workplace while staying true to myself.
	•	Because of this support system, I’ve been able to step into roles I once didn’t feel ready for — and I now walk into interviews and opportunities with a sense of belonging.

Thank you to the PRGRSS team and my mentors — this kind of access changes everything.
[16/05/2025, 15:40:17] Andie: Fantastic noted. I’ll go about collecting these. Thanks
[16/05/2025, 15:44:21] André (PRGRSS Boss) Spence: Thank u
[16/05/2025, 15:53:40] Andie: Also, Sir Sent you PRGRSS report and Danny’s expected Executive Summary for the week. He’s tasked us to keep up with for documentation purposes. ‎<This message was edited>

[19/05/2025, 21:23:05] Andie: Evening Sir!

Great news: I’ve sent over some draft content for you to review tomorrow.

*The draft includes:*

6 highly relevant modules

1 additional module containing an actionable framework based on analysis of mentee input

Mariam's detailed feedback was instrumental.

It required dedicated time to properly synthesize.

I mapped her input against the defined acceptance criteria across the modules.

I feel positive about what has emerged from this exercise.

I’ll keep building on it to refine and tighten things up! ‎<This message was edited>

[27/05/2025, 10:30:23] Andie: *Out current Policy Conflicting Problem*

PRGRSS’ current policy treats professional networking (which Lee is successfully providing) as prohibited behaviour, even when:

- Both parties are consenting adults
- The relationship is professionally beneficial
- Real career outcomes are being achieved
- The mentor is acting within professional boundaries
[28/05/2025, 19:02:57] Andie: Please Sir, I’ll try give you a call back by 9, if you’re hopefully around for like 15min. Ive been particularly tight up with my mother these past two days. But I  plan to send over a few things this evening.🤞

Sent detailed product update email with solutions, as discussed earlier.

Conducted 1.5hr live app testing with Olu tonight. Found critical stability issues missed in previous mentee testing.

Core features (calls, acceptance, scheduling) are working but still breaking intermittently. Hurera will remove messaging limitations immediately upon return and provide ETA for other critical bug fixes.

Olu committed to weekly, condensed, 1hr testing sessions (Mon/Thurs evenings). This consistent cross-platform testing is vital and will improve bug identification and free up my bandwidth.

Synced with Anthony on business priorities. Meeting tomorrow 11 AM to discuss urgent admin panel improvements for better visibility and efficiency, it's been in the backlog and remain underdeveloped causing a lot of slowing down on metrics and better user management without Hurera's help. ‎<This message was edited>

I trust you’re well. I look forward to your meeting link for the afternoon. I appreciate you’re still out and about most likely.

So just sending over this gentle reminder.

Agenda for tomorrow's 1 PM App Stability meeting is finalised on Slack.

Regarding the invite, as I don't have access to the official GPE Zoom account, Anthony is coordinating the official invite send. I'm ensuring it's processed and sent out well in advance of tomorrow.

Thanks,

[10/06/2025, 21:52:32] Andie: *Found Issue with Hurera's May Record*

You said they put down 0.5 days for May - that's WRONG

Actual May days off: 1.5 days (missing 1.0 days)

PROOF - Hurera's own Slack statement (June 2nd):
"Hey Andie, in the month of may there was 1 half day and 1 sick leave"

*Documented evidence:*

May 23rd half day - Announced May 22nd "I'll be having a half day tomorrow" (0.5 day)

May 27th sick day - "not feeling well this morning. will be on a day off today" (1.0 day)

They recorded the half day but completely missed the sick day.

Got full Slack conversation chain. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/06/2025, 22:14:38] André (PRGRSS Boss) Spence: A lot of information could you explain to me after our meeting? Thank you though
[10/06/2025, 22:17:55] Andie: Tried to be as concise with thm as I could be. No worries, will walk through them all. No particular urgency, just have a lot of identified critical core instabilities with the PRGRSS app to address and sort out with Hurera in the morning beforehand, wanted to get you up to speed. ‎<This message was edited>

Getting you up to speed, speak soon! I have an emergency brutal testing session scheduled with Olu this evening, around 6-8pm, FYI.

I have just had a long commitment hand-shake with two active mentors that are going to be dedicating a minimum of 30-45min per week till end of June for brutal testing under my acceptance criteria guidance against ones done by Hurera to catch bugs even faster than our resource constraint has allowed thus far. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/06/2025, 21:37:57] Andie: Zoom task, been posted to Anthony, so hopefully whenever he pickes it up; you will be able to see more into the agenda and we can take what’s left from tomorrow evening. Between 6-7pm, should take 30min total but with Q&A max 45min. ‎<This message was edited>

[17/06/2025, 17:37:02] Andie: thank you Sir, good evening!

PS: what you should know off the back of my email:

-I noticed overly comparing our testing-phase startup to an established government contractor like Niyo
-Niyo's client list (Goldman Sachs, GCHQ) vs your emerging partnerships
-Their G-Cloud listing vs your certification plans (including, needing to look into their ISO, Cyber Essentials playbook)
-Their proven £500K pricing vs our projections

Honest Assessment for Fundraising

Our Better positioning opportunity, internally, from a Product POV is:

"PRGRSS represents the next generation of mentorship technology"
"Building on proven models like Niyo Labs with superior technology"
"Targeting the same £2.5K-£500K market with more efficient delivery" ‎<This message was edited>

[08/07/2025, 09:42:27] Andie: Morning Sir! Received with thanks. And appreciate you sorting this out as expeditiously as you could. 

I’ve been working on the onboarding flows to streamline it more. They are indeed too many but yet what has kept the quality of our much enjoyed matchings.

We should be done finalising it by stand up today.

Please note,It has severe impact on the current algorithm so it’s not a small piece of work atm is in review between me, Hurera and Hashir for long term architectural guidance and sustainable approach. ‎<This message was edited>

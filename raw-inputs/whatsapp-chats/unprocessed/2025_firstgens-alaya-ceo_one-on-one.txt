[14/02/2024, 18:45:23] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Just changed the group chat
[14/02/2024, 18:45:29] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Could you try now please?
[15/02/2024, 09:14:36] Andie: It does, thanks so much! Sorry I fell asleep quite early last night
[15/02/2024, 09:15:02] Andie: Im gonna try now drop a line too, and get the ball rolling
[15/02/2024, 09:15:50] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Glad you got that good good rest😂🙌🏽
[15/02/2024, 09:16:07] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Thanks, the ball does need rolling😂
[15/02/2024, 10:41:38] Andie: It was necessary, life is really lifeing lately

[19/03/2024, 10:14:54] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Oh yes I’ve heard of it!! What a shame you’ve got it. Hopefully you have a quick recovery
[19/03/2024, 10:15:42] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): This event is for higher education practitioners rather than students!
[19/03/2024, 10:16:09] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Also I do know about USW’s first/gen info days…but they have to lag us for our content
‎[19/03/2024, 10:16:10] Andie: ‎audio omitted
[19/03/2024, 10:16:31] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): We cannot run as an organisation if unis just use our lived experiences and resources without paying for the value
[19/03/2024, 10:16:53] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): All we can do at this stage is sign post those students to our social media pages and free newsletter
[19/03/2024, 10:17:11] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): As for the programmes, should they wish to join in the future, we’ll have to ask the uni to pay for their space
[19/03/2024, 10:17:37] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I’m printing flyers and booklets for students later this year
‎[19/03/2024, 10:17:48] Andie: ‎image omitted
[19/03/2024, 10:18:05] Andie: 100% agreed, always have tbh
[19/03/2024, 10:18:27] Andie: Fantastic will keep up to that then, so at least their in the loop
[19/03/2024, 10:18:39] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yes this is the visit the last at USW was talking about
[19/03/2024, 10:18:48] Andie: Awesome sounds brilliant
[19/03/2024, 10:19:07] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Personally, I need to have a chat with someone at USW, I was actually quite shocked they don’t have a WP lead or a strong WP plan, with pretty much 0 budget
[19/03/2024, 10:19:10] Andie: I will just keep to Firstgen overview and as a way to basically market it
[19/03/2024, 10:19:41] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Let them know their is a community and that they aren’t alone🙌🏽
[19/03/2024, 10:19:57] Andie: its pretty strange but I do have access to an insider report if you want to take a look. Didnt get the final one but will send it through its still got good stats and facts ‎<This message was edited>
[19/03/2024, 10:20:38] Andie: Ill be sure to! She wanted to take a break from education but honestly I told you’re so smart, carry on and you will get the support you need
[19/03/2024, 10:20:57] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): We have to balance our work with unis. Because we don’t want to promote a uni that doesn’t actually have a strategy to support them when they arrive, or prioritise budgets to support them…whereas there are unis in England which clearly state a percentage that will be spent on students from lower socioeconomic background
[19/03/2024, 10:21:17] Andie: I just remembered when you mentioned this as I was sitting on their student voice Widening Parteciaption Project to scrutinise things
[19/03/2024, 10:22:02] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yeah send it over or at least screenshots. Because from what I hear, that last was the go to person for WP, and she didn’t know the drop out rates for students from lower socioencmic backgrounds. Or where to find the data
[19/03/2024, 10:22:09] Andie: Didnt realise USW was slacking like cause I have met so many individuals immensily passionate about this area, quite disappointing to learn this
[19/03/2024, 10:22:37] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yeah, I’m shocked to the point I’m going to raise it with someone
[19/03/2024, 10:22:42] Andie: Aight, will get that across to u
[19/03/2024, 10:22:43] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): All is we is ambitious words
[19/03/2024, 10:22:48] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): No strategic plans of intervention
[19/03/2024, 10:22:55] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Apart from outreach (pulling students in)
[19/03/2024, 10:23:20] Andie: yeah it does become a very marketing driven effort rather than genuine support in the end
[19/03/2024, 10:23:33] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I have a meeting with USW next week btw
[19/03/2024, 10:23:42] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Literally this
‎[19/03/2024, 10:24:32] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): ‎audio omitted
[19/03/2024, 10:24:36] Andie: I aint gonna lie I felt moments like this but I am just glad I can amplify the message of making an effort to try university and not solely promote USW
[19/03/2024, 10:24:47] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): We have to start somewhere!
[19/03/2024, 10:24:54] Andie: Fantastic! I can tell you’re pretty ready, all the best!
[19/03/2024, 10:25:07] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Thank you!
[19/03/2024, 10:26:36] Andie: Unfortunately your voice is completely distorted, but I am sure we’ll be able to touch base about all these dets. Wanted to make sure I raised that with you, since you are engaging with’em I dont want to be disconnected to what you’re doing and act out sync
[19/03/2024, 10:26:39] Andie: Thanks for ur take ‎<This message was edited>

[10/04/2024, 17:56:38] Andie: so there are the key figures I typically work with that are heavily involved in engaging with anything widening participation at USW, and outreach, so although I can appreciate the relevancy of the progression team because they are in charge of anything relating to courses retention success, I have been trying to get you in front of higher-ups ‎<This message was edited>
[10/04/2024, 18:00:51] Andie: I would have betted just as much a productive convo with Alex and the rest of key members of her teams, most now working first gens professionals themselves, they have so frequently asked about FirstGens supporting material to complement what they already do. But the report, which also cites Alex, will make this even more clearer to you. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/04/2024, 16:02:11] Andie: Hi *Alaya*, you know when u said *HEFQ* or *HealthQ*, on the subject of them affording your costing through some existing funding channels, do you think this is what they referring to? Just came across it doing some research in education for my final year project which I am due to submit this coming Monday afternoon, mentioning *FirstGens* vital role in supporting *student* aspiration and *retention in HE* a s well as their successful transitioning/exit cause of it ‎<This message was edited>

[16/05/2024, 22:40:50] Andie: Today has marked my journey that has come to an end with my thesis presentation at USW
[16/05/2024, 22:40:53] Andie: Feels surreal
[16/05/2024, 22:41:00] Andie: Just taking a minute to take it all in
[16/05/2024, 22:41:33] Andie: And I have already started to hear a couple of international student firstgents I was helping navigsting the uk it market
‎[16/05/2024, 22:41:40] Andie: ‎image omitted
[16/05/2024, 22:41:53] Andie: The work ur doing Alaya is incredibly important work
[16/05/2024, 22:42:13] Andie: And I am loving ur getting into all the right rooms
[16/05/2024, 22:42:34] Andie: I figured u would realise what I was hearing from USW stuff the structuring is very similar and corporate in a sense
[16/05/2024, 22:42:48] Andie: So lots of politics to navigate but once u have buy in
[16/05/2024, 22:42:50] Andie: Your IN!
[16/05/2024, 23:11:32] Andie: here, btw are you saying that universities like the University of South Wales need to focus on outreach and communication with professionals to secure revenue, but if many students drop out, the universities won't receive the full tuition fees for the full three years (9,250 pounds per student per year)?

And because of this, we need to present a strong financial argument to highlight the importance of student retention, rather than focusing solely on the social benefits?
[16/05/2024, 23:12:50] Andie: woow!! serendipitous!!!! awesome stuff
[16/05/2024, 23:13:45] Andie: networking is my forte so trying to leveraging it for FirstGens sake
[16/05/2024, 23:14:06] Andie: I know ur in the process of becoming a CIC, that will change a few things around how u run affairs im sure ‎<This message was edited>
[16/05/2024, 23:16:00] Andie: haha I really do
[16/05/2024, 23:16:09] Andie: and I love the: wrapping it up in a box with a bow on top for the diversity!!
[16/05/2024, 23:16:12] Andie: go Alaya!
[17/05/2024, 18:00:01] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Amazing!!! Congrats! Make sure you celebrate this weekend
[17/05/2024, 18:01:25] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yes!!
[17/05/2024, 18:04:47] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I need speak to Alexandra but she didn’t have much oversight or influence over any high level strategy. She’s more on the delivery side and that’s it. 

However we’ve kind of realised and concluded that no one really does😂

Will be speaking with the Director about it all in a few months
[17/05/2024, 18:07:11] Andie: Trying to
[17/05/2024, 18:07:15] Andie: Dont know what to with myself
[17/05/2024, 18:07:18] Andie: Learning to chill
[17/05/2024, 18:10:34] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Sleep and eat good food is a great start😂
[17/05/2024, 18:10:42] Andie: Thank youuuu
[17/05/2024, 18:10:51] Andie: Thats a great start indeed
[17/05/2024, 18:11:01] Andie: Sound like a plan

2. What were your thoughts when you saw UWE offering a programme for first-gen students?   
3. How did the programme help you as a first-generation student?  
4. It’s been 12-months since you completed the programme, where are you at now? 
5. [Alaya will text the questions from Q&A in the chat box]

2. What were your thoughts when you saw FirstGens and the support on offer  
3. How did the series of workshops  help you as a first-generation student?

[11/06/2024, 09:44:28] Andie: I am an all-around technically proficient freelancer and start-up advisor (see the links provided), 
primarily focusing on Information Communication Technologies (i.e. EdTech & eCommerce) and, 
more recently, specialising in Generative AI and chatbot development. This specialisation stems 
from my final year thesis titled "Levelling the Playing Field in Computer Science Education with 
Generative Pre-Trained Models." My services include designing, developing, and integrating AI
powered chatbots for websites, emphasising natural language processing, machine learning, and 
knowledge base integration. I will be helping businesses enhance their online presence, automate 
customer inquiries, and provide accurate and efficient user assistance. I landed a client, Diversita 
(https://www.diversita.co.uk/copy-of-client), a London-based company that works with 
neurodivergent professionals. They face recurring challenges that I am going to be streamlining, 
namely, high volume of inquiries, balancing efficiency and personalisation, handling simple 
inquiries, guiding users to relevant information, and limited resources. Once deployed my AI
powered chatbot, I can revolutionise their customer support process and improve the user 
experience for those seeking information on neurodiversity and job opportunities. An example: 
https://www.datacamp.com/blog/announcing-the-new-data-camp-ai-assistant-announcing-the
new-data-camp-ai-assistant. I am drawing inspiration from it to bring this niche tech to Welsh. I 
stand by the belief that Silicon Valley is not only a place but also a mindset.

[11/06/2024, 10:36:40] Andie: I have no deck, is my first time properly doing one, thanks! But if I do manage to send it across once I have done my homework with others I will send it over no problem and thanks again

[22/07/2024, 12:42:03] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hey, so sorry I’ve been terrible on messages. Things have been really hectic from my end post event and it’s only me delivering on ops and sorting stakeholder engagements so I’m knee high in work and trying to keep afloat
[22/07/2024, 12:42:44] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Awesome that you are working with Vee. 

The Conduit is where we are hosting our event, but be mindful that they are pricey and not charity friendly in my opinion
[22/07/2024, 12:43:09] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I would LOVE to be involved in the event - I need to meet Vee in this lifetime😂
[22/07/2024, 12:43:15] Andie: No worries Alaya, been trynna keep aflot myself. I just didnt wanna lose touch with you, cause there is a lot you have good intuitions for.
[22/07/2024, 12:43:27] Andie: Hahah! That made me laugh too loud
[22/07/2024, 12:44:27] Andie: She is a bubble of energy and definitely a great collab if we can pull it off, I am dragging my entrepreneurs community to back us up to make sure it runs smoothly and she expects 150-200 people
[22/07/2024, 12:44:51] Andie: Oh okay! That’s LDN now, I am not suprised
[22/07/2024, 12:45:11] Andie: She said she wanted to make an iconic move so hence why Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 seems an ideal place
[22/07/2024, 12:45:17] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I think this would be too large for Conduit
‎[22/07/2024, 12:45:34] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): ‎image omitted
[22/07/2024, 12:45:48] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Oh Wales! Ok! ‎<This message was edited>
[22/07/2024, 12:46:17] Andie: I imagine this to be LDN as well, noted, no its good!
[22/07/2024, 12:46:21] Andie: But yeah
[22/07/2024, 12:46:30] Andie: we started the convo back in January
[22/07/2024, 12:46:59] Andie: Ive only now managed to get a meeting in to start with the planning and execution 🥲🤞
[22/07/2024, 12:47:53] Andie: I have TramshedTech as a space and potential with Wales Millennium Centre
[22/07/2024, 12:48:41] Andie: And yeah being quite charitable work it would have to not break the bank🥲
[22/07/2024, 12:49:32] Andie: I am trying to be lean as possible with it all, so we can accomodate it and if we fall on a date I would like to be one where u are available to come over so that you can be involved cause it just make sense to me you are!
[22/07/2024, 12:49:52] Andie: It’s very important to me, you are.
[22/07/2024, 12:50:35] Andie: But I do appreciate your spinning plate so if you prefer for me to just keep you in the loop and email you periodically, so be it
[22/07/2024, 12:58:58] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Send over your potential dates and I’ll let you know which ones I can attend! Appreciate it!
[22/07/2024, 13:00:13] Andie: Fab, I will see how our chit chat goes, but pls do feel free to send some over for August, and I will make sure we make it happen more on your terms, cause again I do know there is a lot that's keeping you full hands on deck especially with the new academic year approachin fast
[22/07/2024, 13:01:58] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): The event is in Aug??
[22/07/2024, 13:02:52] Andie: From the way my back and forth with Vee went it does seem she wants to make this Empowered By Vee (EBV) happen by before end of Summer
[22/07/2024, 13:03:15] Andie: The meeting marker was named EBV August Collaboration
[22/07/2024, 13:03:58] Andie: That meaning that we would be mobilising quite fast but ofcos once we have decided on formalities relating to speakers and venue/food the rest isnt so hard cause theres frameworks in place
[22/07/2024, 13:04:02] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Week day or Sat?
[22/07/2024, 13:04:30] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): To clarify, I’m coming down as a guest and not speaker?
[22/07/2024, 13:04:44] Andie: Thats a good question. Wont comment on that yet but can let you know by after Wednesday morning
[22/07/2024, 13:05:45] Andie: You can coming as a speaker as Id negotiate you speaking as to also introduce to all the attendees all the work FirstGens has been involved with and ones that is coming up. That’s my take, however if you want to take a seat back you’re free to do so.
[22/07/2024, 13:06:14] Andie: I just want to test the waters and see how accomodating the team is has we are provisioning quite a lot to make their life easier
[22/07/2024, 13:06:28] Andie: venues cost an arm and a leg
[22/07/2024, 13:06:37] Andie: and catering yeah
[22/07/2024, 13:07:19] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Oh I see! 

Budget for speakers time/ travel or no?
[22/07/2024, 13:08:12] Andie: There wont be a budget for speakers cause we are covering an awful lot for her and she said she will bring in brands so will defo be learning more about expectations and how we’ll be managing such after our meeting this Wednesday
[22/07/2024, 13:08:26] Andie: But I did think of a budget which is dependent on our sponsors
[22/07/2024, 13:09:52] Andie: She is used to do it in London School of Economics but I think its been a bit tight cause the whole event has always been charitable
[22/07/2024, 13:10:37] Andie: We run professional events around the year so thought we could pull this off with my founder collectives ‎<This message was edited>

Yeah I wanted you to weight in like this, hence me presenting the opportunity to be better able to adjust to your needs and also accommodate everyone accordingly, as I managed to have budget for speakers before but it's not always been as easy, when you have several also travelling, let's see.
[22/07/2024, 13:15:17] Andie: much appreciate, we will give it the best shot if it works out! happy days!

[02/09/2024, 13:55:49] Andie: Cool, will remove the message then
[02/09/2024, 13:55:53] Andie: Thanks for the help

[02/09/2024, 14:46:59] Andie: Hey I mean no bother, I know how busy you get! but this opportunity has actually landed on you and they want to get to know you
[02/09/2024, 14:47:09] Andie: A filmmaker named Juanee Scott from the production company It's My Shout is looking for compelling Welsh stories to feature in their upcoming season of short films.
[02/09/2024, 14:47:15] Andie: I shared some information about FirstGens and the vital work you're doing to support first-generation university students. Juanee is very interested in potentially developing a short film highlighting FirstGens' mission and impact.
[02/09/2024, 14:47:24] Andie: Would you be open to me connecting you with Juanee via email to discuss the possibility further? I think it could be a great opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges faced by first-generation students and the crucial support FirstGens provides.
[02/09/2024, 14:49:40] Andie: short films for It's My Shout's new season
[02/09/2024, 14:49:49] Andie: The initiative is known for producing up to 30 short films annually for organizations such as BBC Wales, the UK Film Council, and the Arts Council of Wales. These films have been showcased globally and have won several BAFTA Cymru Awards

Well don! ur pitch is brilliant
[05/09/2024, 18:12:55] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Thank you! My first pitch on stage!
[05/09/2024, 18:16:05] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hello! Thank you for thinking of us but unfortunately I am fully stretched and don't have any capacity for new projects!

I see you have already connected us but please do check with me before sharing my email as I am unable to 
respond to various opportunities! 

I'm already struggling with the amount of emails and opportunities post our launch event, which is great but also need to be mindful of how much I can actually do as the only full-time staff member!
[05/09/2024, 18:55:50] Andie: No worries, Illl run this more by you.
[05/09/2024, 18:56:11] Andie: Sorry for all the initiatives taking. i should have been more mindful ‎<This message was edited>
[05/09/2024, 18:56:33] Andie: Really hope you can get a proper downtime between all this great stuff thats coming your way.
[05/09/2024, 18:56:55] Andie: There is time for everything under the sun, your capacity is whats most important
[05/09/2024, 19:03:42] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Thank you! And love all the enthusiasm and comms you've pushed recently! Thank you. 

But yeah I'm just trying to find my feet atm with lots going on - I have to be laser focused on priorities.
[05/09/2024, 19:04:43] Andie: You do! I figured and thats why I am gonna relax it a bit, to allow that space, it must be a lot, im genuinely sorry, just really want you to scale and succed.
[09/12/2024, 12:36:14] Andie: Hi Alaya! how are you doing? I was creating a very short podcast based on the Impact Report 2023-2024, and came across this no longer being available on the site, thought I'd flag it up to you
‎[09/12/2024, 12:37:46] Andie: ‎video omitted
[09/12/2024, 12:37:52] Andie: I did create the podcast EP based on it, eventually

[09/12/2024, 12:40:08] Andie: would appreciate your thoughts, at your earliest convenience, as I experiment with new technologies for content accessibility purpose, like the ideas I share with Chloe Smith
[09/12/2024, 12:59:01] Andie: and this is the last episode of the series

‎[06/01/2025, 16:13:21] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): ‎audio omitted
[11/01/2025, 07:51:02] Andie: Morning Alaya! sorry been a bit under the weather
[11/01/2025, 07:51:35] Andie: Many Happy returns! and thanks so much for the kind words, much needed boost of morale to weather more job applications, especially graduate ones.
[11/01/2025, 07:51:42] Andie: I just been contracting on and off
[11/01/2025, 07:51:56] Andie: 100% agreed, they can indeed.
[11/01/2025, 07:53:47] Andie: When I said 'podcast EP', I meant a short podcast episode that I created using the Impact Report 2023-2024 as the basis
[11/01/2025, 07:53:55] Andie: It's like how you might watch an 'episode' of a series on Netflix, but this is an audio file
[11/01/2025, 07:54:03] Andie: I'm experimenting with some new tech for accessibility purposes.
[11/01/2025, 07:54:33] Andie: I know the term 'EP' can be confusing; it stands for extended play, and it's sometimes used in music to refer to a release that's longer than a single but not a full album. However, in this case, it's just a term for a short episode within a podcast series I'm making
[11/01/2025, 07:59:30] Andie: ‎You deleted this message.
[11/01/2025, 08:03:37] Andie: Creating a podcast without a traditional studio environment or complex logistics is possible using AI tools like ElevenLabs and NotebookLM. You can begin by generating an audio overview of your content with NotebookLM, which uses AI to convert your written notebook into spoken words. 

After that, create an account with ElevenLabs and navigate to their Voiceover Studio. You can then create a new project and select the voices and accents you prefer, assigning different voices to match your speakers.

Once the script is ready, either transcribe it or format it accordingly before importing it into ElevenLabs. Adjust voice settings such as clarity and stability for a more polished sound, and fine-tune the pacing and pauses between speakers. If you wish, you can add background sound effects or music to enhance the podcast’s atmosphere. 

Once satisfied with the final product, export the audio as a single file. This method allows you to produce a professional-sounding podcast without the need for a physical studio, offering flexibility in both production and distribution
[11/01/2025, 08:08:05] Andie: Question 1: How can the pronunciation of names be fixed?

using ElevenLabs to transform NotebookLM audio. This process involves automatically transcribing the NotebookLM audio using AI and then importing it into ElevenLabs. Once in ElevenLabs, you can adjust the pronunciation of names through the platform's voice editing tools. It may be necessary to manually edit the phonetic transcription of the names to achieve the desired pronunciation, but it's not that hard as the phontic of Alaya, is uh-LIE-uh? if so the you just write it like that to help it pronounce it correctly.

uh (as in the "a" in "about")
LIE (rhyming with "high")
uh (as in the "a" in "sofa")
[11/01/2025, 08:08:33] Andie: How can a podcast be created without the challenges of tech, getting people in the same room, and travel expenses?
[11/01/2025, 08:10:15] Andie: *Could blog posts be used to create episodes?*
 Yes, this is a viable idea. The possibility of creating episodes using blog content. Always using NotebookLM and associate tech to make a podcast from blog posts. NotebookLM can generate an audio overview of text-based content, which can then be refined using ElevenLabs or further in NotebookLM before moving over, just to get it write.
[11/01/2025, 08:10:27] Andie: this is how you get the right precision to how u want your podcast effectively

[11/01/2025, 08:12:03] Andie: *How can the "AI" feel of the voices be addressed so that it feels more like a conversation between two humans?*

You might find it strange to listen to AI in a conversational format. Using ElevenLabs lets you adjust voice settings to make the AI voices sound more natural and less robotic. You can tweak settings like stability, clarity, and similarity. The "Speech to Speech" feature also helps refine intonation and emphasis. Adding pauses between speakers and fine-tuning the timing and pacing can further enhance the natural flow. *Cloning your voice*, I know, spooky is another option you have, then you can make it whatever you need to be a host on the Podcast that has your style or a replica-ish. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/01/2025, 08:13:50] Andie: *How can content be generated that could also be used for social media?*

The AI-generated content can be repurposed. The AI voices say useful things that can be written up for social media and other content. Once audio is generated, transcriptions can be used for written content.
[11/01/2025, 08:14:32] Andie: here's an example of me transcribing this programmatically using Gen AI to the highest quality, similar to what we would have done when interviewing those FirstGens ages ago, at the stage of FirstGen development.

[11/01/2025, 08:21:43] Andie: Et voilà! The screengrab above illustrates how, after generating the transcript and ensuring it sufficiently matches, I automate the replacement of the "Speaker 1" label using Word's built-in "Replace All" feature. I first set the text to be replaced and specify what it should be replaced with.
[11/01/2025, 08:22:40] Andie: reading this u can find the highlights that u find coolest to read/hear and re-purpose the content for other platform, and have fun!
[11/01/2025, 08:23:58] Andie: take your time, thanks!

[15/01/2025, 16:57:15] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): How have you been doing?
[15/01/2025, 17:27:27] Andie: I was knocked out for 3 weeks since Xmas due to bacterial infection but doing much better after antibiotics and this is the time I was brainstorming ideas and chit chatting with Urfan, but I do remember you introducing me especially about Circle. defo have a play! expect a couple more protoypes and a/b test. ‎<This message was edited>
[15/01/2025, 17:29:07] Andie: and yourself?
[15/01/2025, 17:39:58] Andie: Look forward to the focus areas being confirmed and the person in charge of the platform liaising with us, and get hands dirty on iterating its betterment
[15/01/2025, 17:56:52] Andie: Alaya, thanks for your feedback on the clickable and functional protoype you've got. In answer to your question, the prototype I've created is built using a combination of web technologies. 

These are all designed to be flexible and adaptable. So, while it’s not currently an app, it is possible to turn it into an app, with some additional edit, so its a solid template to convert to such, I'll try give u a protype dummy app to play with. ‎<This message was edited>
[15/01/2025, 17:59:01] Andie: other frameworks in existence enable us to deploy the same code base as both a web application and a mobile app. This approach means that we can potentially leverage the work I've already done and adapt it for use as a mobile app.

I've been good thanks! Getting stuck into the New Year and loving that I have so much more support around me. Needed to delegate leadership! Not just tasks and projects
[16/01/2025, 18:25:58] Andie: Best decision ever, it looks incredible and you have years of experienced individuals poured into you! Unstoppable 🔥👌
[16/01/2025, 18:26:09] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): You make it all sound so easy😂🙌🏽👏🏽 your a tech whizz man
[16/01/2025, 18:27:01] Andie: Trust once u have some one break down things in your everyday language with analogies your brain wont stop piecing together all the thinggs u never thought possible to built
[16/01/2025, 18:27:51] Andie: Thats how Notion can be Notion, someone knew the right formula of technologies to combine to pull it off and then create the most highly customisable tool ever to be shipped
[16/01/2025, 18:28:38] Andie: social media has made the creators economy possible the new tools that technology will give us will make any human able to do what takes a team to do
[16/01/2025, 18:28:50] Andie: Actual proof of what I just said!
[16/01/2025, 18:29:23] Andie: this usually takes weeks. It took me far less.
[16/01/2025, 18:31:59] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Wow, fair play
[16/01/2025, 18:32:18] Andie: Btw the “app” i showed u uses notion to store all the data of the users and directory
[16/01/2025, 18:32:29] Andie: This wasn’t possible few years ago
[16/01/2025, 18:34:25] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Questions 

-can we put notifications on the app? E.g notify someone's phone when a live event is about to start 

-Can you conduct live events on this?

-based on what you've said, can AI be added then? E.g someone signs in and clicks on 'I am a first year student' and their course or content is tailored to 1st year
[16/01/2025, 18:35:39] Andie: Yes to all of these! Cause the level playing field of complex system development such as this has really levelled so you can quickly go from prototyping in a much more quicker way to concrete solutions. ‎<This message was edited>
[16/01/2025, 18:36:33] Andie: So essentially to have certain more advanced features you would from early maybe rely on a third party that has done it all for you and then later customise further to protect it as Intellectual Property with the capital as code can also be IP and algorithms that do such jobs under the hood.
[16/01/2025, 18:37:10] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Ahhh cool. 

Would you reccomend that FirstGens identify key functions and examples of othrt platform features we want?


Also, do you suggest that this example should be used for MVP only? Or can it be built out to the extent that it's a product
[16/01/2025, 18:39:18] Andie: Absolutely brilliant approach, very much so! It would save you lot of development times and allow to have an already built product to onboard users and then allow you to take longer to build the more preparatory version that FirstGens technologies owns and doesnt have to pay licence or subscription to somebody. But that’s some we’ll sweated development time and NDAing work so you can protect that legacy.
[16/01/2025, 18:40:14] Andie: Yeah to it can be built out to the MVP cause then you will have a clone of it in which you will continue development to the point then to make your user base excited of every knew release like Notion did!!!
[16/01/2025, 18:40:53] Andie: thats why I like your circle idea Alaya!
[16/01/2025, 18:42:56] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): So you think Netifly and Circle are 2 good contenders for the MVP
[16/01/2025, 18:43:02] Andie: This, eventually you will be able to depart from them and do a real owned technologies platform as you do have a EdTech product and as it scales with his user base that has global potential your costs of various interplay of tech under the hood your brand will bear potentially making it unbearable and you just having to justify why you spending so much in tech to other suppliers and pouring into their pockets. If they retire certain features you like, you screwed or have to pay more for them to keep you having them without newer release breaking your legact product.
[16/01/2025, 18:43:49] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): the only other thing that comes to mind, is data. 

Are we able to see how many people download a guide, read a blog, log into it? Download the app?
[16/01/2025, 18:44:08] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Can people have single sign on accounts
[16/01/2025, 18:44:22] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I imagine the answers are yes you can take over the world😂 by any means necessary lol ‎<This message was edited>
[16/01/2025, 18:45:23] Andie: Netlify one I used yeah? It only is housing a custom builld platform I hard coded. But Circle will provide prebuilt components and ofcos all the 24/7 assistance for your team to do deeper customisation but at a price!! Thats what we are weighing here. You just need to decide firmly on what you will ship in your MVP and can already work out its costs. But then when its scaling you dont want to reach astronomical overheads
[16/01/2025, 18:46:02] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Got it
[16/01/2025, 18:46:45] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Excited to dream it all into existence hehee. Thanks for helping me see what's possible!
[16/01/2025, 18:46:47] Andie: Yeah that is the bit that will require plugging a data analystic platform to your website activity cause that otherwise will require building such analytics features so often less is more so might be easier to just integrate it with sth u may be pay for altready within the marketing department so you look in that case more in integration like HubSpot and other things.
[16/01/2025, 18:47:27] Andie: Thats the beauty of Softare as a Service (Saas)! Dream it up and then getting to actually build it like Lego let you build your dream toy or whatever ‎<This message was edited>
[16/01/2025, 18:47:45] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): We'll figure out all the features 
Then cost analysis of both!
[16/01/2025, 18:48:18] Andie: Excellent idea! Roadmap, brainstorminga, and mind mapping will help with all that
[16/01/2025, 18:48:37] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): The team and I will have roles sorted by beginning of Feb. So I'll be in touch then for next steps
[16/01/2025, 18:49:10] Andie: Ive had a meeting last year with a company based in Europe that has scaled a lot and emailed at the time is called Odoo they could really integrate well everything with their existing solution that is highly customisable and similar to what your current firstgen site uses
[16/01/2025, 18:49:47] Andie: Sanity CMS if that makes any sense
[16/01/2025, 18:50:02] Andie: Sure thing, let me know how you want to proceed
[16/01/2025, 18:50:16] Andie: But keep in mind also ERP based web platform
[16/01/2025, 18:50:20] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): We use Sanity and Netifly  for our website
[16/01/2025, 18:51:01] Andie: An ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) web platform like Odoo is a software system that helps businesses manage and integrate core business processes across different departments. Odoo is an open-source ERP solution that provides a suite of applications designed to streamline various business operations such as:

	1.	Accounting: Managing financial data, invoicing, and reporting.

	2.	Inventory Management: Tracking stock, orders, and shipments.

	3.	Sales and CRM: Managing sales, customer relationships, and marketing campaigns.

	4.	Human Resources: Managing employee records, payroll, and recruitment.

	5.	Project Management: Managing projects, tasks, and workflows.

	6.	Manufacturing: Managing production lines, scheduling, and order processing.
[16/01/2025, 18:51:01] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): What's ERP
[16/01/2025, 18:51:38] Andie: And this is what at the time i was big on to save FirstGens money as their developers work with yours to built the most customed experience and platform so virtually anything you want
[16/01/2025, 18:51:42] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I'll check out Odoo
[16/01/2025, 18:52:20] Andie: Just one name but conceptually is known as ERP solutions in business, so that can form part of your cost analysis
[16/01/2025, 18:53:54] Andie: Yeah I crawled the site and played with Sanity, very cool one! Just that they lock you in with their product as you scale and require certain more features. The hard fact that convenience always comes at a cost in tech cause they do the heavy lifting but ofcos technical human resources can also be a headache and overly expensive so you strike a balance where you can if u can have the best of both worlds.

[16/01/2025, 18:56:19] Andie: And this is all I ever wanted to tell you in the last years of brainstorming FirstGens ideas for a EdTech platform that you have full IP and control over, beyond relaying on developers to pay to change every minimal thing and going back and forth. ‎<This message was edited>

[30/01/2025, 12:04:07] Andie: This is what I am deploying recently for clients that want to fast prototype or test features that their no code/low-code solutions limits them or bump them up to more paid tier for

[30/01/2025, 12:50:29] Andie: no that is absolutely fine, this is more to your point u made for the navigation flow of current firstgens uk, as I had similarly implemented such before so gonna see how it turns out on Sanity ‎<This message was edited>

[30/01/2025, 12:53:38] Andie: alrighty I think I am gonna go ahead and do that then, thanks! it would be very good to have it poked around and nicely constructively critiqued, gets us faster to your end goal! a functional EdTech product that can scale.
[31/01/2025, 06:43:49] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Morning! Looking at the NavigateU which says 159-299 per student annually.

Can u confirm these the platform costs? 

And how much might it be for your time building our MVP?
[31/01/2025, 06:54:05] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Would the live webinars be linked  another platform such as zoom? Or YouTube live? 

Or does it host its own without need for another supplier
[01/02/2025, 10:42:25] Andie: Hi Alaya! Sorry for the late response, I had another website launch this week so was ensuring with the dev team that it was all operational so had such a busy time with it but we are live🥳🙌 just waiting for them to finish some re-touches: https://afjcardiff.com/
[01/02/2025, 10:42:38] Andie: To your points
[01/02/2025, 10:46:16] Andie: Those were estimated figures but I can certainly find out better for you if it would reasonably total up to that, it’d be going very much by market rates to stay competitive but also because if integrated and developed in line with the UK Gov G-Cloud I break down to you on my latest email where I tagged Urfan as well then it means that any institution that wants to onboard your services would just do so by going directly to the Cloud based EdTech platform directory that the gov has launched for a while now, more about it here, so this ties directly with the pricing model as I’d be browsing, comparing and constrasting with competitors in the space who however dont exactly have the same niche therefore exclusivity that FG EDUCATION SERVICES LTD may have
[01/02/2025, 10:47:55] Andie: https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/articles/GCloud+14+agreement+goes+live+12112024092000?open
[01/02/2025, 10:48:29] Andie: I believe this should be certainly on the roadmap for you, since you are aligned to educational goals set by certain gov agencies and partners
[01/02/2025, 10:48:41] Andie: The part of particular note is “G-Cloud offers public sector organisations a straightforward and compliant way to purchase cloud based services, all of which are available as off-the-shelf, pay-as-you-go solutions to further simplify the buying process. 

Over the lifetime of the G-Cloud agreement, £2.3 billion, an average of £192 million each year, has been accrued in commercial benefits, representing significant savings for the public purse.”
[01/02/2025, 10:49:45] Andie: My proof of concept is how NavigateU could so, but to be part of such directory is an eventuality as at the moment onboarding to it seems to be closed and done seasonally
[01/02/2025, 10:50:37] Andie: I’ll confirm all these costings for you and also my time building with my dev team conducting Quality Assurance a refined and fully deployed MVP
[01/02/2025, 10:55:37] Andie: That’s entirely up to you especially if you want to be strappy (opting for “doing-it-yourself” way to save you overhead costs, and likely exponentially skyrocketing software tiers changes as you grow n grow), in my case I had chosen to go for a gradual integration inside your EdTech solution cause there’s available open source (meaning licensed to be freely used but maintained by the community, closest thing you might have heard is Wordpress)

[01/02/2025, 11:09:25] Andie: I find delight in getting around exorbitantly high corporate solutions like Salesforce and HubSpot CRMs and the likes with alternative, elegant solutions.

The catch with these platforms is that they often make their money back when you scale nicely, and they lock you in nicely too. ‎<This message was edited>
[01/02/2025, 11:12:52] Andie: My prototype of NavigateU uses a specific stack of technologies for prototyping purposes, but my developers don’t necessarily work with that same stack.

That said, the technology can be adapted to whatever you choose to build your EdTech solution with, if that makes sense.

And if Netlify, your current host, allows you to scale well enough according to our audits, then we will also just deploy all of these things from your existing payment plan with them since it hosts your Sanity CMS solution. ‎<This message was edited>
[01/02/2025, 11:15:50] Andie: But I do think you got the gist, and believe you’ll like the approach of these community-driven and well-supported open-source solutions, like WordPress.

Another being https://www.rocket.chat/, which I continually recommend to my clients. The reason for this is that you’re saving costs long-term, even though it’s not always the coolest, most expensive software out there that you could well afford.

But the question is: Do you want to get locked-in? This goes back to my point about ownership in our previous conversation. ‎<This message was edited>
[01/02/2025, 11:17:50] Andie: Thanks for Sanity CMS, will be playing with it per your guidelines
[03/02/2025, 12:45:09] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Cool stuff. I know one of the dancers!
[03/02/2025, 12:57:08] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Thanks for the info. 

It's mostly difficult to wrap my head around the jargon and what it all means technically. Though, I have a jist of what you mean.


At the largest scale, there's roughly half a million students entering university who may want to access our platform for support.

Let's go off the long term vision.

My gut says we need to own our own tech. But perhaps MVP can start with what is reasonably priced and looks really cool. Students won't use something that doesn't look cool. 

E.g download the app on App Store rather than a more long winded way. 

To clarify, u want the MVP to look pretty good, in order to get students to engage rather than any roadblocks to testing.

It costs what it costs. Would be great to see an example of costs when you've got time
[03/02/2025, 12:58:35] Andie: Your gut is right
[03/02/2025, 12:58:53] Andie: Apologies for not being more careful with my lingo
[03/02/2025, 12:59:44] Andie: I have the time now so doing the work with my dev team
[03/02/2025, 12:59:56] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I need minimum info and just the answers. What I've come to realise is that in the role of CEO with so much to oversee, I basically need little amount of details
[03/02/2025, 13:00:20] Andie: He works for a wed dev agency in Cardiff so we seeing what fits the bills
[03/02/2025, 13:00:29] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Because there's too much detail for me to digest over marketing, platform, sales, recruitment and finance
[03/02/2025, 13:01:00] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Oh that's cool. Tell him I said a big thank for looking
[03/02/2025, 13:01:04] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): How many are in the team
[03/02/2025, 13:01:04] Andie: Absolutely
[03/02/2025, 13:01:53] Andie: 3 of us including me, cause I code along side them but test the quality of their solutions
[03/02/2025, 13:02:10] Andie: Optimise for cheap but elegant
[03/02/2025, 13:02:27] Andie: Haha will do!!
[03/02/2025, 13:02:45] Andie: They love firstgens.co.uk
‎[03/02/2025, 13:03:41] Andie: ‎image omitted
[03/02/2025, 13:03:54] Andie: We were just reviewing it
[03/02/2025, 13:06:31] Andie: Ill making more succinct going forward Alaya, I have caught myself making a bit inaccessible thinking of it retrospectively
[03/02/2025, 13:07:00] Andie: So absolutely well put and shrew observation
[03/02/2025, 13:07:48] Andie: I am also thinking of how all these integrate well with all u currently pay? Anything else besides Netlify subscription
[03/02/2025, 13:07:57] Andie: Like maybe Zoom ?
[05/02/2025, 13:14:06] Andie: Hi Alaya
[05/02/2025, 13:14:08] Andie: how are you?
[05/02/2025, 13:14:12] Andie: the figures are in
[05/02/2025, 13:22:54] Andie: This project Alaya is estimated to cost £10,150 - £11,800 (includes circle.so yearly subscription and my time together with my QA dev) which is pretty conservative even. We are architecting your chance to transition smoothly out of Circle.so should ever want to and also providing you with the entire product (platform) asset, sitemaps etc.
[11/02/2025, 16:18:49] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Currently don't pay for Zoom. pay for Microsoft teams though as most unis use that platform.

[11/02/2025, 16:37:59] Andie: 100% will be able to have a very solid MVP by June/July 2025 no shadow of a doubt
[11/02/2025, 16:38:59] Andie: I'll address now the rest with more executive summaries. I've broken a lot of these things down already, took a while but I think I got a good overview of all the landscape.
[11/02/2025, 16:41:27] Andie: glad you got a smooth moving in, it's really a complex thing to navigate especially in this day and age and with the state of UK housing market
[11/02/2025, 16:43:49] Andie: I look forward to joining the call and hearing the testimonials. Circle Ofcos does offer an option beyond their most premium package, where their team can assist in developing an MVP. However, I anticipate their quote might be on the higher side. Please feel free to reach out to them if you wish, but in the meantime, I'm more than happy to assist and keep you in the loop. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/02/2025, 17:03:37] Andie: Also very feasible for project planning I do use MoScoW project managment
[11/02/2025, 17:05:33] Andie: My team will send you an invoice, and we can then agree on the payment terms. We can either set up installments or break the payments down by milestones achieved to clear each invoice over time as we focusing on shipping the MVP milestone and scope agreed beforehand, that's how I work, but let me know if it works for you.
[25/02/2025, 09:27:33] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Thanks for the heads up. Pushed me to schedule a call with them.
[25/02/2025, 09:27:45] Andie: I already did✅
[25/02/2025, 09:28:17] Andie: And got all the numbers, but didnt want to give you fragments so was gonna just send you a summary doc
[25/02/2025, 09:28:43] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Aw wicked! You are one step ahead. I read and respond to messages 1 by 1🤣
[25/02/2025, 09:28:48] Andie: but will forward you my contact at Circle so and our recap
[25/02/2025, 09:29:06] Andie: I have to be😅
[25/02/2025, 09:29:08] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): That would be awesome thanks

[25/02/2025, 09:29:51] Andie: I had such a fantastic call with them
[25/02/2025, 09:30:13] Andie: Obvs had to be late at night cause of US timing
[25/02/2025, 09:32:41] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): The board would like to see your quote aswell. 

Do you know when I can expect it?
[25/02/2025, 09:33:06] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Lastly, how's the website tweaks looking?
[25/02/2025, 09:37:07] Andie: Of course will get one sent out today by noon, cause wanted to do so after my meeting with Circle and hearing your side of things, before presenting all of these things at once ‎<This message was edited>
[25/02/2025, 09:39:03] Andie: Very feasible, I’m done understanding your web framework so that I could test without affecting the site in realtime, so will have you try it at your end within this week
[25/02/2025, 09:43:59] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Is your infection cleared up?

I'm down now😅 currently dismantling a box of tissues
[25/02/2025, 09:44:19] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Good idea. Thank you!
[25/02/2025, 09:57:01] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Exciting! Thank you so much
[25/02/2025, 10:03:14] Andie: Completely gone and ive been fortifying my immune system, cause aint welcoming no more bugs😂 got stuff to get done!
[25/02/2025, 10:03:42] Andie: Anytime
[25/02/2025, 10:04:25] Andie: Just little heads up! Perhaps USW has already previously re-directed their interest on FirstGens, but if a waiting list is still in place this would be good for them to be signed up

[25/02/2025, 11:24:31] Andie: Yeah, that’s all it’s ever been. These are academics, so all they do all day is discuss findings. But it’s entrepreneurs like you who actually deliver concrete solutions that do work. That’s why it’s so great that you’re in a position to drive change and even influence national agendas. ‎<This message was edited>
[25/02/2025, 11:24:55] Andie: All these people I have ever seen interested is their retention of students on their course
[25/02/2025, 11:26:51] Andie: The course Ive just graduated from got closed by the vice chancellor after 30 years of running successful all because there was apparently not enough 1st year uptake of the course anymore and everyone was coiming to do it as top-up years so coming in 2nd or just 3rd years to get the Bsc, and this was deemed NOT PROFITABLE enough nor susisitanable by the standards of the new vice chancellor
[11/03/2025, 17:28:07] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Oh wow!!! That's so sad
[11/03/2025, 17:28:19] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I'll be getting in touch with the uni this month
[11/03/2025, 17:28:35] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Any updates on website? And quote breakdown? ‎<This message was edited>

[11/03/2025, 18:09:47] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): are you able to give me a date for when website updates would be changed
[11/03/2025, 18:10:32] Andie: Mostly likely by end of this week cause Ive has a lot on my plate with the team getting all of this market reaearch and business analysis and strategy ready to present to the board with all the costing and market fluctuations
[11/03/2025, 18:10:47] Andie: So say Friday launch time?
[11/03/2025, 18:11:32] Andie: You’re welcome here for this🌱🔜🌳
[11/03/2025, 18:12:11] Andie: Market fluctuations I went through white papers and other individually verified reports on the current state of things and this what it averaged to
[11/03/2025, 18:12:32] Andie: But I got a fully documented with such findings and how it maps to all that
[11/03/2025, 18:25:49] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Sounds good! I just needed a date to make sure I'm following up so things don't life! Appreciate you've got a lot going on and taking the time to help out!
[11/03/2025, 18:26:35] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yeah pleas send over and one of our team members needs to review it along with the other options
[11/03/2025, 18:27:16] Andie: awesome will do, should I cc you as well and which email is it now same as ever?
[11/03/2025, 18:27:20] Andie: thanks

[13/03/2025, 19:41:34] Andie: Hi Alaya! I just concluded a cybersecurity meeting with my partners in the US that take care of full compliance across all ISO, Data Protection, Information Security, GDPR and what have you
‎[13/03/2025, 19:41:48] Andie: ‎image omitted
[13/03/2025, 19:42:34] Andie: Just wanted to let you know that I will be sending you and Urfan a Product Requirement Document tomorrow breaking everything down and addressing al that we discussed to date.
[13/03/2025, 19:46:26] Andie: Since Circle.so uses Amazon Web Services infrastructure (the house where all the Circle’s and so partners and their students and FirstGens intellectual property will be residing) and stores data in the US (as confirmed by discussions with their Sales representatives), I conducted due diligence by engaging with an independent team whose practices I follow. 

The goal was to assess their cybersecurity compliance and potential vulnerabilities, ensuring their security measures are robust while also helping you gain stronger buy-in from your partners by proactively addressing data integrity and leak prevention. ‎<This message was edited>
[18/03/2025, 13:30:03] Andie: Hi Alaya, I hope you’re doing well. Apologies for not communicating this clearly earlier. I’ve been wrapping up the final loose ends of the Circle platform project, including weeks of research with my team, which culminated in reconvening with the cyber team based here and in the US. 

Unfortunately, that meant I haven’t yet had a chance to revisit the things we discussed about firstgens.co.uk as I had hoped to last week.

I also underestimated the complexity of unraveling the developer’s implementation, which has made the process more challenging than expected. 

I wanted to update you and reassure you that you’ll hear from me soon with more concrete changes and a finalised memo outlining everything.
[18/03/2025, 13:34:40] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi Andie, hope all is well. When you talk about the Circle platform, you're taking about your own project and not FirstGens right? Double checking!
[18/03/2025, 13:38:03] Andie: No, I do mean FirstGens, because I’ve been in conversations with them on and off over the past few weeks. 

The plan was for me to pass the details on to you so we could explore whether I could help build things out at a much more reasonable price than what they charge for concierge. 

This would allow you to spin up a version for your MVP, trial it with partners, make adjustments, and then launch the app by September for the new academic year. ‎<This message was edited>

[27/03/2025, 10:45:22] Andie: Yeah hope this break down helps a bit better
[27/03/2025, 10:45:49] Andie: I have held back from sending you the full PRD aka Product Requirement Document
[27/03/2025, 10:46:03] Andie: Looking forward to touch base then
[27/03/2025, 10:47:14] Andie: I wanted to get feedback from the rest in Kanban style by sharing this with them if that’s okay as to further refine the EdTech platform unknown unknowns and ensure is as comphrensive as possible, am I still allowed to share the full prototype I worked on end of last year and showed you in preview?
[27/03/2025, 10:48:51] Andie: I also was looking forward to figure out a bit better success metrics (KPIs) but I understand you are building more effective processes and systems
[27/03/2025, 10:50:10] Andie: So is that okay? as a follow up to the one you just sent
[27/03/2025, 10:52:08] Andie: Meaning a a Product Request Kanban Board or Feature Request Kanban Board
[27/03/2025, 10:52:28] Andie: This type of board is specifically designed to collect, organise, and manage product or feature requests from various sources.

[27/03/2025, 11:22:27] Andie: Oh okay no worries, they are not banking on that, just were happy to advise on security aspects of things.
[27/03/2025, 11:22:30] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I said we needed to collect quotes for different approaches to the technology, circle or MVP set up.

We understand the MVP in-house is too expensive

[27/03/2025, 11:44:42] Andie: It’s been on my mind, but I’ve been struggling personally to present it in a format that you and the board would be able to digest well. The other startups, Ive worked for in the past are a bit more technically inclined, so there are certain systems and processes I’m still refining.

[27/03/2025, 11:52:07] Andie: This highlights my point about Circle being essentially the winner, and I believe you’ve intuitively known that since the moment you mentioned your interest in it, Alaya. 

You did mention you were attending meetings with others who have adopted it, and I’ve also noticed that The 93% Club uses it as well. ‎<This message was edited>
[27/03/2025, 11:53:32] Andie: Btw the platform comparison tables show Circle standing out as the most cost-effective option, with the lowest cost over three years, regardless of potential changes or fluctuations in their pricing tiers. ‎<This message was edited>
[27/03/2025, 11:59:11] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yeah having you do the cost analysis on platforms has been super useful
[27/03/2025, 11:59:41] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Don't worry about the proposal as we won't be doing the MVP internally
[27/03/2025, 11:59:44] Andie: Pleasure trying to take a bit of your plate
[27/03/2025, 12:02:44] Andie: Alright, that’s okay. The proposal is more tied to Circle and my sales rep, whom I’ve been in touch with. I’ve also circled back to you over email today, so I hope that helps whenever you guys are ready.

[27/03/2025, 13:42:52] Andie: oh okay so now I really understand the bandwidth and capacity at which you are operating, thank you Alaya
[27/03/2025, 13:43:45] Andie: this makes so much more sense, then I can literally really strip down the amount of data and research I have done on Circle and its implementation time especially creating spaces for different partners and ensuring there is correct segmentation and onboarding workflow.
[27/03/2025, 18:32:52] Andie: Alaya u took the word out of my mouth proper bootstrappy vibes
[27/03/2025, 18:33:00] Andie: Lean as possible
[31/03/2025, 11:50:16] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Just applied for £2500 grant which would cover the costs of Circle for a year! Fingers crossed

[31/03/2025, 12:26:30] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): 360 that
[31/03/2025, 12:26:55] Andie: Nice onee! I do come a cros loads of disparate ones cause sometimes they really do come in handy
[31/03/2025, 12:27:16] Andie: Wicked 🙌
[31/03/2025, 12:27:51] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Have a good week ahead!

[22/04/2025, 16:41:03] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi Andie! Did you enjoy your Easter weekend? I slept so much - I needed rest. Was lovely.

I've got some green lights from Ian. I've got about an hour between 5-6 to get send the updates on navigation names and homepage plan!
[22/04/2025, 17:23:30] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I've come to a hot chocolate shop with NO WiFi🤣 4g is having issues.

I wouldn't imagine a place to not have WiFi - must be purposeful! 

Will try tomorrow morning!
[23/04/2025, 20:48:41] Andie: Hi Alaya! Great news, I have been spending the evenings going over our discussion, and will be in touch soon thigs week.
[23/04/2025, 20:49:28] Andie: I just wanted to give you this heads up cause I know I have been a bit quiet, scattered across my daily routines. But very grateful for your feedback.
[23/04/2025, 21:01:13] Andie: and yes somewhat, been juggling rest times with caring for my mother, not sure I mentioned she had an heart attack last summer just before I graduated and then got briefly hospitalised so now I am doing all I can to balance careers goals and progressing all the more intentionally in my professional positioning

[12/05/2025, 13:44:56] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi Andie! Hope you are doing well after the weekend? 

I've only just clocked we have this page - https://firstgens.co.uk/navigating-university-programme
[12/05/2025, 13:45:29] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): You can essentially update that page
[12/05/2025, 14:46:08] Andie: Ciao Alaya! thanks so much, noted thanks.
[12/05/2025, 14:46:43] Andie: and yeah weekend wasn't too bad, was commemorating my father's death 3yrs since he left us
[12/05/2025, 14:47:12] Andie: it just unfortunately occurred to me last minute and took the time to reflect on the journey and all he's left within me
[12/05/2025, 14:47:50] Andie: thaks for asking, hope you got off a great start of your week too! Aim to give you a major update late in the day on how things are unfolding
[12/05/2025, 14:53:51] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Must have been a very emotional day. I'm sure he's in spirit and so proud of you Andie.
[12/05/2025, 14:54:14] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I attended a baby blessing/shower which turned into a proposal party!
‎[12/05/2025, 15:21:39] Andie: ‎audio omitted
[12/05/2025, 23:43:23] Andie: Hi Alaya! Just letting you know that I had some technical setbacks on the backend so couldn’t share anything with you today. Ill be back at it tomorrow to see if I can troubleshoot it all and get sth to appear in the right places as we discussedz
[12/05/2025, 23:43:54] Andie: Apologies for the late text coming off from reading a whole lot of technical docs on things
[12/05/2025, 23:44:03] Andie: Goodnight 👋
[13/05/2025, 06:52:16] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi Andie. My phone is on do not disturb mode to encourage me not to be working too late. Got your message now and fingers crossed this can be sorted with a bit of troubleshooting
[13/05/2025, 06:53:14] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Let me know if you have any incline that it's not going to go ahead
[13/05/2025, 07:42:44] Andie: Heyy! Noted thanks, let me see how it goes throughout today’s and will be sure to keep you posted on any major progress made 🙏
[13/05/2025, 13:24:14] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hi Andie, really keen to know if we are going to have the website ready for tomorrow or if I need to consider a plan B. I've got about 3 hours of the working day remaining to sort a plan B
‎[13/05/2025, 13:26:31] Andie: ‎audio omitted
[13/05/2025, 13:31:52] Andie: short answer is a kind of, due to the complexity of certain page flows and creation and migration of some existing one, more explained in the VN.
[13/05/2025, 13:45:16] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Are you under the impression we want an inbeded form?
[13/05/2025, 13:45:41] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): There might be some miscommunication - we jsut want a button that links to the form
[13/05/2025, 13:46:21] Andie: that's the same thing I meant, no embeeded form, you already made that clear saying the workflow will led to data capturing outside of the site.
[13/05/2025, 13:47:25] Andie: so no hope nothing confused you, cause I am referencing everything back to notes and reference guide I have which is enough to inform changes and development
[13/05/2025, 13:48:16] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Can I clarity whether we will have the pages agreed ready by tomorrow?
[13/05/2025, 13:48:56] Andie: most definitely the undergraduate one, but the home page may need bit more background working cause of teething issues.
[13/05/2025, 14:01:05] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): It's great that we’re on track to get the undergraduate page sorted for tomorrow.

I know someone who’s really familiar with the CRM, so it might be worth me letting them make the edits to save you the hassle of troubleshooting.That way, we can keep things moving smoothly with the website, while you focus on the the undergrad page.
[13/05/2025, 14:02:52] Andie: Alright Alaya, if you do know someone really familiar with the CMS like you are saying feel free to bring them on board as I will very happily would love collaborating with them, as two on certain operations are better than one and I want you to have the best of me working on the most product-defining aspect of your progression and FirstGens growth🙏🏾let's do it!l
[13/05/2025, 14:03:55] Andie: apologise if communication wasn't exactly proactive was quite bogged down and absorbed by ensuring I could deliver this on time
[13/05/2025, 17:13:20] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): The website update project is on pause for now. Unfortunately they are busy at the moment. 

I've mentioned to the Directors, but they are wondering why there's such issues if you have experience with Sanity. 

I know you've developed websites but have you not used Sanity or something?
[13/05/2025, 17:23:06] Andie: Hi Alaya,

Just to clarify, I do have experience working with both open-source (Wordpress ecc) and commercial (Squarespace, Shopify, Wix, Terminalfour used by USW) Headless CMS platforms, including Sanity. 
Just your setup by whoever built was tailored differently from ones Ive come across before.

The main challenge here has not been the CMS itself, but the fact that quite a bit of the setup and decision-making was done before I was fully brought into the loop on the overall vision and technical structure. ‎<This message was edited>
[13/05/2025, 17:23:47] Andie: To keep things realistic and efficient, I focused first on getting the most important page functional. 

However, certain blockers were unfortunately unavoidable, particularly when unexpected errors cropped up that required additional R&D.
[13/05/2025, 17:24:12] Andie: The original developers have had significantly more time working with the custom stack built specifically for FirstGens, while I’ve been navigating it solo with only the onboarding and context you’ve been able to provide so far.
[13/05/2025, 17:24:53] Andie: It wasn’t until our recent catch-up and your final conversations with Ian that I gained a clearer picture of the end-to-end implementation goals. 

I’m fully committed to understanding and aligning everything, but I do ask for some patience as I continue to piece it all together, especially given the bespoke nature of the build.
[13/05/2025, 17:25:42] Andie: Please let me know if I can proceed for the rest of my working day or this is halted till, do pls advise when? Thanks
[13/05/2025, 17:36:54] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): The previous developer said the pages shouldn't take long as we are moving existing blocks to other pages, or adding existing content blocks to pages, not creating anything new.

I was asked what road blockers yu have come across. Not sure what you mean by R&D!

Please can you have as many pages as we discussed we would have ready for Monday? Tomrorow's a big day and need clear direction on where we are travelling.

I just need to know if there's anything you won't have ready
[13/05/2025, 17:39:24] Andie: I hear what previous devs say, I am just speaking from my level of experience. 

I think for me the only thing remains the same as what discussed. 

Getting this undergraduate page resolved, and keep you updated, with my last update coming out tonight as I refocus on finishing it up.

And then make sure that everything else discussed pending thats proved challenging is resolved and off the ground then by Monday, I am cool with such a deadline please.
[13/05/2025, 17:39:29] Andie: Deal?
[13/05/2025, 17:40:29] Andie: Sorry and by R&D I mean my own wrapping my head around what’s where/how (exactly) and ensuring things aren’t broken by thoroughly testing. ‎<This message was edited>
[13/05/2025, 17:45:32] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Monday as in yesterday
[13/05/2025, 17:46:56] Andie: Nws, my whole premise is basing off our discussion last week I am just deprioritising the thing that could have caused issues so homepage for the thing that matter most the undergraduates pages and links out to the form no? ‎<This message was edited>
[13/05/2025, 17:49:19] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): >undegraduate page 
>The above page links to a Navigating University Page

I said ideally, it would be great to have the homepage updated because students might hover over there. But, the homepage includes moving things over to completely new spaces such as 'Abous us' > 'Our Team'
[13/05/2025, 17:49:50] Andie: That’s right thats the order in which I am working as well
[13/05/2025, 17:49:55] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): And the student overview
[13/05/2025, 17:49:56] Andie: We are on the same page ‎<This message was edited>
[13/05/2025, 17:50:12] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): So I'm trying to ascertain if all will be completed by tomorrow. If not, which ones won't be ready
[13/05/2025, 17:50:32] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Considering the road blockers
[13/05/2025, 17:51:10] Andie: I think the one that will most likely be not ready is all of those that require actual blocks within the page moving but navigation will be ready as also leading it to the student page and then if u have a ready link to go into that button u want, that one too can be🙏
[13/05/2025, 17:51:14] Andie: Sound?
[13/05/2025, 17:52:19] Andie: Meaning then that the “Our” flow will be appearing but the content addition will be reduced to what I can manage by end of this evening ‎<This message was edited>
[13/05/2025, 17:52:51] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Which ones require actual blocks within the page moving? Don't they all include an update of where the blocks are
[13/05/2025, 17:53:27] Andie: Hold a sec lemme go back to notes and page layout preview
[13/05/2025, 17:55:16] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): So to confirm, the below pages will be ready tomorrow morning?

-Student Overview 
-Undergraduate page 
-Navigating University Programme page
[13/05/2025, 17:55:33] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): The homepage is deprioritised
[13/05/2025, 17:56:16] Andie: Potentially creating a new "Advisory Board" section and moving those team members to a separate area.

Reorganising how the team and advisory board members are displayed, potentially splitting them into distinct sections.

Moving the "Our Team" section from the homepage to a new "About Us" page.

so might for now hold off on the Our Team option but the menu on the nav will be appearing regardless without for now that one. ‎<This message was edited>
[13/05/2025, 17:56:31] Andie: nailed it yes!
[13/05/2025, 17:57:35] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Don't understand last paragraph!

[15/05/2025, 09:24:06] Andie: Morning Alaya! Thanks for confirming that, I’m going to make some tweaks and then let you know to give it all final green lights nws 👍
[15/05/2025, 12:07:20] Andie: FINITO! Pages completed, pending review and approval, finally got everything to work this setup is a bit painful not gonna lie:

MOST IMPORTANT + SURVEY LINK:
https://firstgens.co.uk/api/preview?secret=TRNTwVIz7HtV&slug=/navigating-university-programme

2ND MOST + ROUTING TO NAV PROGRAMME
https://firstgens.co.uk/students/first-generation-undergraduate

3RD MOST 
https://firstgens.co.uk/students/overview



I have been quite perplexed in some places but for the sake of not continually stopped I have made some notes, on where my perplexieties have been the most and left the rest to discuss over voice with you whether VN/Call/Final meeting whatever our capacity can manage.

Within experiencing more intimately the entire set up and workflow, I have a better estimation of what it takes to do what, and I would already say that anything that involved intricated sections that have stuff inside stuff. Or pages with several sections. They do take at least 30min of rearranging and fiddling which if you encounter validation challenges or saving progress ones then it quickly become more like 45min.

Let me know how everything appear on your end: Mobile, Tablet, PC. Thakns! ‎<This message was edited>

[15/05/2025, 18:07:45] Andie: the content was substituted and it became Stone colour

[15/05/2025, 19:14:57] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Sorry I've been editing away here.

It's back on the page thank you
[15/05/2025, 19:16:07] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yes all is finished!

There's a few edits I'm going to make on my end by the main and most important parts are there! 

I know this has been more complex than you expected so appreciate your time trying to get your head around it all. 

I'll get the unis to launch early next week!
[15/05/2025, 20:11:06] Andie: Nws I figured. Looking forward to hear what the Unis think of it all, it a grand endeavour and finally taking off
[15/05/2025, 20:11:37] Andie: I have eternal patience with technology when it works is great when its bugging out is close to your worst enemy
[15/05/2025, 20:12:05] Andie: productivity killer no.1. I’ve seen too many times in industry.
[15/05/2025, 20:12:38] Andie: Thamks for having patience too and reviewing these 🌱 I am pleased that you are. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/08/2025, 14:06:10] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hey Andie! Will be awesome
to have you help out. Thanks for getting back to Josie. 

Thanks for sending over. I'll make a note to take a look at Notebook LM video created. At the moment we are currently stacked with launching a programme and haven't got breathing space for much else. 

We'll look at development stuff in Jan once programme is at and end😁
[11/08/2025, 14:25:45] Andie: Nws Alaya, just didn't want to forget in case in the future this comes back handy! thanks, looking forward how this newer cohort all pan out, I am confident it will be impactful as ever!

[26/08/2025, 19:15:42] Andie: You’re allowed to share content too now
[26/08/2025, 19:16:01] Andie: Part of our presenter list with more control.
[26/08/2025, 19:18:50] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): By the time I tried Josie was waiting for the last peeps
[26/08/2025, 19:19:05] Andie: Ooh darn, got you
[26/08/2025, 19:19:19] Andie: Yeah its been very fiddly but we will find a much better way
[26/08/2025, 19:19:51] Andie: I definitely think but Josie didnt like it too much having the extra joining device sharing a spotify tab but maybe one very focus on our playlist
[26/08/2025, 19:19:53] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I played from my phone at the end
[26/08/2025, 19:19:56] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): What did that sound like
[26/08/2025, 19:20:11] Andie: it was very far in the back and all the voices overshadowing it
[18/09/2025, 07:19:48] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Morning Andie!

How are you doing?

I was thinking about our academia workshop. Don't think we could get Vee in as a guest speaker? 

Or perhaps we plan it in advance for next year
[18/09/2025, 12:36:02] Andie: Hi Alaya!!

Not too bad thanks, busy times but pacing myself. And you?

I think with her returning to the UK after all that she’d gone through with her PhD studies in the US, my immediate thoughts that it can be early, as she might be quite caught in a lot. 

But I reckon she’d be open to it, as she really was when it had come to planning to have ever running her annual Empowerment workshop in Wales even at a conceptual level at the time. ‎<This message was edited>
[18/09/2025, 12:37:02] Andie: the fact that you’re suggesting next year it’s a shout as the programme would have matured even more but I think, should test the appetite of her team already and see whether they would already be behind what you have planned for this cohort, cause it may as well be an easy yes.
[18/09/2025, 12:38:43] Andie: I am happy to make an intro if I can find again the right contacts and then I’ll put you on to continue the conversation. 

At least we open a channel of communication and present/future conversations. 

Keeping that warm for us, similarly to how we was able to do with Circle.so, who will always remain open to offer a waiver for a social good enterprise. 

And negotiating pricing for a growing community with important clients pipeline. ‎<This message was edited>
[18/09/2025, 13:24:09] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Indeed, feeling the busyness of Sept and a new season! 

Sounds like a good idea - test appetite! 

Let me get back to you when we're ready for intro as this weeks a little crazy - presenting to an audience of a few hundred people tomorrow!


Thanks Andie👊🏽

Have a lovely weekend when it arrives.
[18/09/2025, 16:58:38] Andie: Yes test appetite indeed🥂

No worries, you do what you need sorting out. We can always come back to all this.

And do have a brilliant weekend too!!
[07/10/2025, 18:42:25] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hey Andie! How many students in the room tonight?
[07/10/2025, 18:43:57] Andie: Hey Alaya so we are at the 20 mark so far
‎[07/10/2025, 18:45:32] Andie: ‎image omitted
[07/10/2025, 18:57:52] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Thanks so much Andie
[07/10/2025, 18:59:40] Andie: pleasure, no worries! your idea of moderation, as ever been key to the success and smooth running of things. sorry to hear of the few dropouts Josie told me but we are ON and she is amazing! engangement has been strong on all fronts.
[07/10/2025, 19:06:05] Andie: Btw i do have to say that we have been averaging 20-25 each session so far
[07/10/2025, 19:06:32] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yes that's why I was worrying about numbers. The key learning has been that term time doesn't work for most students...no matter how much good intention they have. The reality is it's a lot onboarding to a new uni and multiple other things
[07/10/2025, 19:07:57] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): We are going to make some big changes moving forward. Focusing on e-learning for them to complete before uni starts 

Then a group chat to support them though but no mandatory webinars.

Maybe 1 panel a month or every 2 months but not fortnightly webinars
[07/10/2025, 19:09:00] Andie: i think that’s even shown in the way we all gone through signing up to all kind of societies and extra activities and what will ever matter is what gives you the biggest ROI your degree.

connections and any other key thing that keeps you afloat at Uni and contributes to your long term success. 

Once it clicks yes couldnt agree more nothing else will matter and it will all fade in the background, as “luxury”. Students time tends to be luxury and we all have been at some point in the illusion of “free” time. ‎<This message was edited>
[07/10/2025, 19:10:29] Andie: That sounds like a flexible restructuring and great foresights. 

I think it would work and I think finding a way to gamifying with even FirstGen merch down the line like print on demand kind of thing could really raise up the stakes. 

And also make them feel a stronger sense of accomplishment rather than box thinking and forgetting that the true value is what ROI Firstgens provisions give them. 

Then hopefully a stream of testimonials can flood in🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[07/10/2025, 19:12:47] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yes I was partying until Dec😂😂😂😂

When you've got in from a long day and you jsut want to hang out with your housemates.


We've had so many say they want access to recordings. So we need to listen to the need and work around it
[07/10/2025, 19:14:57] Andie: aah tell me about it! i was a serial signing up to everything and then just realised it was a losing battle, but its very easy to not appreciate that enough once you are out of it. 

And the reality is truly some folks unis and/or courses are a lot more intense than others and that will automatiecally reflect on our attendance records, which i bet if plotted will show S curves more than just linear growth or stable if you know what i mean. 

so Alaya your future adjustment are definitely going to be brill! ‎<This message was edited>

[10/10/2025, 12:38:49] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hey! 

Thanks so much for sharing.


My hesitation is the same as the other org - do we have the capacity to manage an intern, as they are essentially inexperienced!

I also wonder how useful it would be for them, considering the app we might go to does all the leg work in terms of computer science.

All they might do is add content onto the platform - which Josie could do, minus the stress of managing an intern????

On the pros, I guess it could take the admin off Josie. 

Let me know if you have any  thoughts. I'll chat with team about it!

Can I get back to you end of penultimate week of October? ‎<This message was edited>
[13/10/2025, 12:55:09] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Andie was Cirlce 1k or 2k for the year?
[13/10/2025, 12:59:28] Andie: Hey Alaya
[13/10/2025, 12:59:31] Andie: for the Circle plan we were looking at (the Professional tier), it was £89/month, so just over £1k for the year. The more advanced Enterprise plans were in the £2k-£3k range.
[13/10/2025, 13:00:51] Andie: also just double checked yeh, unless they have any price dwindling cause of cos of usual business T&Cs that's still the case 1k, which will very likely in crease as you scale as it is directly proportional, all telling from using a formula known as Total Cost of Ownership. Just as quick memo. ‎<This message was edited>
[13/10/2025, 13:02:04] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Thanks! Writing up the budget for the pilot
[13/10/2025, 13:02:30] Andie: Fab! I just had the meeting with USW on Friday, to hear them out fully,  matter of fact and yes on the pros ‎<This message was edited>
[13/10/2025, 13:02:38] Andie: it could entirely take the admin off Josie
[13/10/2025, 13:03:29] Andie: this is how they envision an intern operation going as, just a single doc with sample leg work for competent computer science, particularly the good apples, as obvious the department was making me wary of all that. And how they'd like a win win situation, if capacity could be created for it. Happy to support in anyway I possibly can Alaya, of cos. ‎<This message was edited>
[13/10/2025, 13:04:52] Andie: doc loading.

[28/10/2025, 12:21:00] Andie: Oh nice I am in the middle of applying for one in Global Innovation etc at LSE 🥂 cheers to us then😂😂
[28/10/2025, 12:21:14] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): When would we need to give an answer to USW as well!?
[28/10/2025, 12:21:15] Andie: Love the sound of that🙌🤷‍♂️
[28/10/2025, 12:22:19] Andie: Lemme get back to you on that cause typically its by end and beginning of November cause then they have them places to start for January and they can wirite a reflective piece
[28/10/2025, 12:23:03] Andie: Id say there’s still about a week and half, im currently drafting job descrip for the department head Dr Jarvis just cause I want to establish longer term relationships with them and pipe them to my other clients too, as I build up capacity for others and myself ‎<This message was edited>
[28/10/2025, 12:24:49] Andie: All the very best with that btw🤌🏾 its so amazing to see how far you’ve come Alaya! As a first in family even👌 very very cool!
[28/10/2025, 12:27:05] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): How many interns are they paying for in total
[28/10/2025, 12:27:33] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Global innovation is right up your street.
[28/10/2025, 12:29:00] Andie: Its unpaid, the host decided entirely the whole aspect of retribution cause they value more having a very reliable.

and beneficial placement experience that totals up to 70hrs and the interns can actually come back to report on.

but ofcos mileage and few other things are always appreciated especially relating to onboarding goodies to make them feel part of the team etc nothing other than that. ‎<This message was edited>
[28/10/2025, 12:29:29] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): So the student isn't paid?
[28/10/2025, 12:30:08] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): So it's part of their credit unit? Instead of them attending classes?
[28/10/2025, 12:30:11] Andie: 🙏 lets see how it goes, a major piece is that the rest is about social mobility on big hard problems I am tackling technical training in the UK due to increased Cyber Threat and Educational disparities
[28/10/2025, 12:30:15] Andie: Nope
[28/10/2025, 12:30:19] Andie: Exactly
[28/10/2025, 12:30:24] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Oh right
[28/10/2025, 12:30:26] Andie: I think about 10 credits or so
[28/10/2025, 12:30:29] Andie: Yeah none of that
[28/10/2025, 12:30:38] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): How many students do they need to find placements for
[28/10/2025, 12:31:11] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Super relevant. Did you see the recent Whitepaper on skills and education?
[28/10/2025, 12:31:14] Andie: The optimal is a pair of 2 so they can help each other with taks but they can be different faces of the same coin. Max they say for big projects they’d like to give out 4 ‎<This message was edited>
[28/10/2025, 12:31:20] Andie: I need to!!!!! Pls where’s that at? ‎<This message was edited>
[28/10/2025, 12:31:41] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): I mean, do they have a course of 100 students and need to find placements for all 100
[28/10/2025, 12:31:53] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): What I am trying to understand is if we were to apply, what's our chances
[28/10/2025, 12:32:08] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Because there's a huge difference in making an application if there's 5 students available v 200
[28/10/2025, 12:32:19] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Considering our time and effort on application v potential outcome ‎<This message was edited>
[28/10/2025, 12:32:47] Andie: No these are year 2 - Computing students doing their Bsc and theu will be about 30 to 60 em cause these days they uptake has been slow and people to transfer courses coming into 2nd year
[28/10/2025, 12:33:09] Andie: Exactly 100%
[28/10/2025, 12:33:27] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): It's really insightful 

They are pushing skills focus due to skills shortage gap. Make it relevant to your work and studies when talking to stakeholders.

[28/10/2025, 12:33:34] Andie: But whats more relevant its appealing to their direct areas of interest by give them as much of a taks diversity scope
[28/10/2025, 12:33:56] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): So dealing to apply is end of first week of Nov
[28/10/2025, 12:34:01] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): What's the application process
[28/10/2025, 12:34:35] Andie: Thats why i had to take the time reviewing their modules and then comparing to say u guys and draft something that will speak to them more. Majority say 70% have neurodivergence so want accessibility friendly workplace and the likes
[28/10/2025, 12:34:55] Andie: Which can be the bit of headache if ur not already designed to work that way in some aspects
[28/10/2025, 12:35:44] Andie: You prep a similar doc like the one i send even just as table, can cc me and u mainly send back to the Professor in charge and the rest the liasion person in career will deal with FirstGens help you refine things
[28/10/2025, 12:36:07] Andie: They just care about due dilegence and that the students arent taken for granted and a ride
[28/10/2025, 12:36:29] Andie: Theres seem to be a boom of neurodivergent finding themselves at home more in Tech
[28/10/2025, 12:37:07] Andie: I would say so tentatively need to go back over the notes cause i gave myself up to mid to end this week back 2 weeks ago when i spoke to the faculty
[28/10/2025, 12:37:52] Andie: Wonderful cause im appling for a fund with a few org for a chance to win 1 Milion of investment to lead Innovation in Education in the UK. Feels so huge so got my Royal Academy of Engineering mentor to help out since she is a deep alumni with them at InnovatUK

[28/10/2025, 12:40:13] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Awesome mentor. Deffo need application strategy and oversight for something like that.

We won an Innovate UK year ago. Give it a good shot!
[28/10/2025, 12:41:44] Andie: Thats very encouraging thanks! Yeah got a few more days to go, gotta be all in by the 30th but there is another one in MedTech and i am experimenting with some Generatice AI tech to prevent Diabetes Type 1 hospitalisation and reduced admissions to reduce the burden on the NHS. Just a little homage to my dad who passed away due to it poorly managed.
[28/10/2025, 12:42:33] Andie: All inspired by Google recent Cancer new therapy miracles reported: https://www.eweek.com/news/google-gemma-model-cancer-therapy/

The rate and pace of innovation is really compounding a lot
[28/10/2025, 12:42:57] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Incredibly meaningful work. He'd be so proud. Good luck with it! Baby steps forward
[28/10/2025, 12:43:46] Andie: Absolutely baby steps😂🙏 gonna need a lot of that thank u!! You remain a big inspo so keep up the morale and take us to “Mars” before Elon Musk does😂😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/11/2025, 13:28:14] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): looool
[12/11/2025, 13:28:46] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hope you've had a good week?

Gentle reminder that I need the q&a's and quotes from first webinar. Hoping to wrap up the first guide this week!
[13/11/2025, 11:41:53] Andie: Hi Alaya! Not too bad, at a Business Show Conference in LDN atm, so as soon as I get back access to my workstation, I’ll be able to revisit that too. But I do remember me not yet having a note taker joining that particular one so that’s why notes haven’t been ready. Its locked inside Microsoft Stream which is all FirstGens accounts exclusive access alongside transcripts which i was going to use.
[13/11/2025, 11:42:11] Andie: Hope you’re week is moving along well too!
[13/11/2025, 11:42:57] Andie: Lmk if there’s anything you can do for that blocker I did mention it on the team group. I’ll check later today if I find anymore on it.
[13/11/2025, 14:05:55] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Oooo sounds fun!
[13/11/2025, 14:06:40] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): You are correct. Not taker at that point. I seem to remember you sending me a top quote but no idea where you sent it.

I'll have a dig from our end!
[13/11/2025, 14:07:02] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Thanks Andie
[13/11/2025, 18:39:09] Andie: Yeah its been quite an intense one but really helped me with expanding my understanding of what technogical solutions do work and are a good value for money especially for SME clients i try to accelerate growth and make hold ownership of their technological stack
[13/11/2025, 18:39:50] Andie: Im gonna need to dig better from my end too. But at the very list there is most definitely a recording/records of things on ur end cause i have this in the group that jog my memory
‎[13/11/2025, 18:40:35] Andie: ‎image omitted
[13/11/2025, 18:41:02] Andie: I quite positive you reffering to this one
[18/11/2025, 10:17:29] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Morning!

It had the principle setting activity in there
[18/11/2025, 10:18:06] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Do you have time to fish out the quotes from our speakers and the q&a's for students?
[18/11/2025, 11:49:56] Andie: Morning Alaya! Let me see what I can manage on my end during launch time and send such over an email to you (12/13), then get any feedback from you. Shouldn’t be that complicated.

But would you be able to grant me access to the recording you can try either my info@andiekobbietech.com or andiekobbietks@outlook.com.

Would say go for the 1st one cause Teams may allow the access permissions more easily. That’s been my greatest blocker.

And yeah im aware it had critical initial setting out of things in it, unfortunately any of my efforts to retrieve anything from it was a stumbling block after another.
[18/11/2025, 11:51:09] Andie: Also can you confirm is this one yh, in the shoot? 2h30min thanks! ‎<This message was edited>

[27/08/2025, 08:26:00] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Morning!


General Feedback 
-keep the code on last slide 
-Andie, could you collect all questions gathered throughout the session that go unanswered. Josie can place in the end of session reflection doc 

-Andie, would be great if you could bullet point key quotes or summarise guest speaker points for me to add to the newsletter (I wonder if it's useful for Fathom to join for this purpose).


Tech Feedback
-Notify Josie if Menti is not not presenting 
-Andie, could you take screenshots of all positive comments on group chat
[27/08/2025, 11:24:22] Andie: Noted @⁨Alaya (1st Gen CEO)⁩ thanks for bringing these notes together
[27/08/2025, 11:25:08] Andie: And yes I think it would be a lot useful to have a back up recorder like Fathom doing that for us in the background, to streamline it all. As it does so per speaker as well.

[02/09/2025, 11:20:36] Josephine Gyasi: Hey hey - just catching up on these!
[02/09/2025, 11:22:07] Josephine Gyasi: I’m on first gens today & tomorrow this week @⁨Andie⁩ - Let me know if you want to jump in a call with me again before the next session on Tues. I’ll be building the content this week so busy with that but free maybe tomorrow end of day or next mon/Tues 🙂
[04/09/2025, 11:35:07] Andie: Hi @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ since I’ve just managed to catch up properly with you, and it’s been quite hectic on my end, let’s do this on Monday then. Please let me know the kind of availability you have for that day, thanks
[05/09/2025, 13:19:12] Andie: Hi there @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ ! 
How’s things? Feel free to share any pre-workshop stuff you already got ready in an email.

Please let’s lock-in a time pre (Monday still works, but time? Can accomdate you) the next session so we can have a legit run through and ensure we are perfectly aligned and I can test things collectively, as if it’s too short noticed we may experience avoidable challenges. 

I am trying to calendar this atm, so would help to hear where you’re at as well.

I am quite big on thorough testing. Technology fails, for disparate number of reasons. Testing proactively solves it 99% times. ‎<This message was edited>
[06/09/2025, 09:39:08] Josephine Gyasi: Hey! Yeah all good, still recovering from my trip to Italy! How are you?

I’ve scheduled a call with the facilitator 2-3, so maybe worth meeting before that at 1.30? Let me know what works as I’m flexible on Monday after 12.

I still need to finalise the presentation slides. So can share them later on Mon, or Tues. I have a finalised timed agenda we can go through & let’s try and sort music as that was the biggest tech issue from my side. 

Let me know how that sounds 🙂
[06/09/2025, 13:46:38] Andie: Hi Josie!! No worries, sounds good to me. Let’s keep it to Monday then. I am not too bad. Just trying to keep all this organised and running as smoothly as possible.

Definitely worth doing that so let’s go ahead with that plan. Feel free to send me a teams invite.
[08/09/2025, 12:13:25] Josephine Gyasi: I sent an invite for 12.30 can you make that or is later better? ‎<This message was edited>
[08/09/2025, 12:13:48] Josephine Gyasi: I’m happy to meet EOD when I’ve finalised the slides, just let me know
[08/09/2025, 12:21:34] Andie: No worries then we can meet EOD, feel free to tweak the invite pls thanks
[08/09/2025, 17:03:31] Josephine Gyasi: @⁨Andie⁩ I’m on the call now - if tomorrow works best let’s do then as I’m still working away
[08/09/2025, 17:05:34] Andie: yeah was gonna ask you know where this was sent, joining now, just came off another meeting. thanks.
[09/09/2025, 18:28:50] Andie: @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ just trying to join back in but you did seem to be able to hear me so was figuring that out
[09/09/2025, 18:28:53] Josephine Gyasi: Hey! are you joining?
[09/09/2025, 18:29:35] Andie: Please let Fathom in
[09/09/2025, 18:29:41] Josephine Gyasi: Ok sure
[09/09/2025, 18:29:50] Andie: thanks im in the lobby for what it says here

[09/09/2025, 20:29:14] Andie: @⁨Alaya (1st Gen CEO)⁩ 

some extracted key quotes and summary of the guest speaker Holly's main points for the newsletter. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

🌟 *Guest Speaker Highlights*: Holly Willis

🎓 *Academic Background*

Graduated from Durham University with a degree in Archaeology and Anthropology

Completed a placement year at Unilever in marketing

Currently starting a law conversion postgraduate course

Secured a training contract for 2027 at Mishkonderaya

🌈 *Personal Journey Insights*

Key Quotes

11:52-12:04: "I'm a first Gen state educated working class... I basically had to navigate uni life quite a lot by myself."

52:22-52:37: "I didn't do anything in first year. I didn't know what an internship was. I didn't know what networking was. So the fact that you guys are learning about this now is so valuable because there are so many first year opportunities that I missed."

🔑 *Top Advice for First-Year Students*

Time Management

Use digital calendars like Outlook for organising academic and personal schedules

Color-code different activities

Plan backwards from assignment deadlines

Be flexible and leave some unscheduled time for spontaneity

*Career Exploration*

47:44-48:11: Discovered career interests through:

Joining university societies

Trying out different roles (e.g., social media, marketing)

Being open to exploring unexpected paths

Learning Approach

Use digital note-taking tools like OneNote

Prioritize reading that directly supports assignments

Don't feel pressured to read everything

💡 *Inspirational Takeaway*

49:50-50:13: "It doesn't matter... if you do realise, oh, maybe it isn't for me, then that's so fine... Most things, you don't have to have a degree in to actually go on to do it."

🌠 *Unique Durham University Experience*

Participated in unique college traditions

Balanced academics with multiple extracurricular activities

Engaged in netball, ballroom dancing, and college events

These are my hand-picks, scanning through the transcript, but you can find more with exclusive access to Fathom and the other back-up AI-integrated recorder, tldv.io, you should have received email by now on:

community@firstgens.co.uk
alaya@firstgens.co.uk

[11/09/2025, 15:43:12] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Using note taker is a great shout for capturing the session. We can use the transcript to ask AI to create guides and ideas for future social media posts  etc. 

Allowing you to engage with the students which is proving to be helpful! 

Thanks for sharing Andie.
[23/09/2025, 16:59:00] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Hey @⁨Andie⁩, hope you've had a good day? Josie and I and wondering whether you'll be joining the webinar tonight?

[23/09/2025, 19:04:15] Andie: Absolute pleasure upwards and onwards 🌱 congrats on how everything is progress shaping up really nicely! ‎<This message was edited>
[23/09/2025, 19:23:22] Josephine Gyasi: It’s so good having you there to support @⁨Andie⁩ as it allows me to relax into the flow. I’m also enjoying you hyping up the chat! Gets everyone engaging more 🙏🏾
[23/09/2025, 19:23:27] Andie: @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩  just wanted to say that these intermediary breaks within session are incredibly therapeutic and let you let stuff sink in, i am sure that everyone can feel the same, refreshed! such a fan! ‎<This message was edited>
[23/09/2025, 19:24:09] Andie: yeah i realised over time that hyping up and validating, really triples engangement and get more people laid back to talk/open up ‎<This message was edited>
[23/09/2025, 19:24:16] Andie: the interst effects of human psychology ‎<This message was edited>
[23/09/2025, 19:24:27] Andie: real honour!

[23/09/2025, 20:32:38] Josephine Gyasi: So good!! Epic quote.
[23/09/2025, 20:33:04] Andie: It looks like the peak of attendance cause u have way more invited on the list & the settings for it too ‎<This message was edited>
[23/09/2025, 20:33:40] Andie: But cause u use the same link each week I do think this list fluctuates but gonna investigate it a bit more to get right attendance volumes
[24/09/2025, 08:23:40] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): We'll have to change the role title from Tech lead to Hypeman!
[24/09/2025, 08:24:39] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): We'll make sure to include this in the programme learnings!
[24/09/2025, 10:59:00] Josephine Gyasi: still confused by what you mean! haha
[24/09/2025, 10:59:07] Josephine Gyasi: The link is different each week!
[24/09/2025, 10:59:15] Josephine Gyasi: we ahd some new ppl from QMUL join, is that what you mean?
[24/09/2025, 10:59:29] Josephine Gyasi: Also - please so share roundups via email 🙂
[24/09/2025, 11:00:35] Andie: Yeah that’s what I meant cause I actually thought this batch was already fully onboarded from the very start
[24/09/2025, 11:01:34] Andie: So I’d imagined a pre-existing expected metric of attendance and certain expectations set between you and Alaya around certain KPIs
[24/09/2025, 11:02:18] Andie: Which then we are able to track quantitatively and qualitatively across this masterclasses running for our target FirstGens groups
[24/09/2025, 11:03:04] Andie: Thats my understanding in order to move forward to more and more institutional buy ins and make FirstGens the standard for navigating 🧭 university when first in family
[24/09/2025, 11:03:39] Andie: Sorry still be wrapping my head round certain things🥲
[24/09/2025, 13:17:23] Josephine Gyasi: I seee
[06/10/2025, 17:28:49] Josephine Gyasi: HEEEEY
[06/10/2025, 17:29:00] Josephine Gyasi: Are you free for tomorow’s session? @⁨Andie⁩
[06/10/2025, 17:29:19] Josephine Gyasi: can you also confirm what email you’ll be using so i can make sure you have the right permissions...
[06/10/2025, 17:29:35] Josephine Gyasi: we’ve got an extra special guest who will be delivering most of the session!
[06/10/2025, 17:32:50] Andie: Heyaa will be using the same as last time, but feel free to test whichever gives you most permission flexibility as last time it was hard to have acccesibility. 

Happy to run a quick proper check in for it. I think my andiekobbietks@outlook.com should work just fine tho
[06/10/2025, 17:38:20] Josephine Gyasi: Ok! FYI I’m hopping in to meet with vivi at 6pm for a tech run through as it seems i cant edit permissions to the event! see you tomorrow 🙂
[06/10/2025, 17:44:16] Andie: Oh okay nws! Be best to test it as earliest as you can have me in then tomorrow, just so that we have that piece of mind that we’re not fiddling around. As at times weird stuff just happens with Teams
[06/10/2025, 17:44:54] Andie: If anything comes lmk👍 all the best for it
‎[06/10/2025, 17:48:28] Andie: ‎image omitted
[06/10/2025, 17:54:29] Andie: Also may I know are you on a paid version of Microsoft Teams? @⁨Alaya (1st Gen CEO)⁩ & @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ as I see Community…etc being the main email used to be the organiser for this sessions. There is some privacy and data configs that can do with some review. The stark exmaple is this email and previous that I realise don’t hide everyone’s else like in a Bbc email this would remain unattainable.
[07/10/2025, 17:33:07] Andie: @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ Heyy how are we doing for tonight? all set? was just reviewing few things from past session and thought I'd ask.
[07/10/2025, 17:39:10] Josephine Gyasi: Yes indeed! I’m kicking back for this one so just need to check and test that vivid ppt works when we jump on at 6!
[07/10/2025, 17:39:18] Josephine Gyasi: Thanks for checking in🙏🏾
[07/10/2025, 17:40:36] Andie: awesome!!🥂
[07/10/2025, 17:40:57] Andie: no worries! team work makes the dream work.

[07/10/2025, 18:02:50] Josephine Gyasi: yhh that’s what i thought! haha not letting a student in my accident again
[07/10/2025, 18:03:09] Andie: not a chance!!!

[07/10/2025, 18:03:55] Andie: its actually done to get off me scammers
[07/10/2025, 19:19:07] Andie: " THE best kind of budget is the one that you actually use! "

fab quote from our speaker Viv, tonight.

such a goldmine is gonna be this post-event transcript. ‎<This message was edited>
[07/10/2025, 19:29:48] Andie: " Money is about buying freedom and not just crap, believe me you'll have more of it later to buy crap with it " cit. Viv

just handpicked gut quotes
[07/10/2025, 19:35:05] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): 😂😂😂😂😂😂 sorry she's hilarious ^
[07/10/2025, 19:36:16] Andie: im telling u, she could just dabble as stand up comedy, she is SO GOOD!
[07/10/2025, 19:36:41] Andie: really trying to get the Firstgens to ask away so we can capture more value in the chat as well🙏🏾 ‎<This message was edited>
[07/10/2025, 19:39:40] Andie: however you secured such a gem of a speaker, truly well done!! 

Ive been to several finance talks and ive never come across anything this valuable, real, practical, actionable. 

With a lot of personable insights and friendly lingo.
[07/10/2025, 19:43:18] Andie: A whole lot of questions have rolled in, and I believe so much value has really been captured here. She keeps bringing very down-to-earth, FirstGens-friendly analogies which, I’d say, and I think I can stand on that for the rest; should connect well with the attendees.

Leaving you a few flying thoughts so I don’t easily forget, as I would. ‎<This message was edited>
[07/10/2025, 19:44:20] Josephine Gyasi: 😆🙏🏾
[07/10/2025, 19:50:07] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): While it's been challenging with the realities of aligning with students' calendars at such a busy time time, I'm really proud of the work we do, the people we bring in and the impact we make, whether it's to those live or those catching up online. 

As always, a big thanks both for facilitating this transfer of knowledge🚀🎓
[07/10/2025, 19:55:45] Andie: As you should be, Alaya!!!!! If you think about it and look at the bigger picture, this is often a long, tedious, and treacherous path but slowly and surely, it really does compound. 

And FirstGens is compounding for real, as there’s now a system in place to capture all this value, track it, analyse it retrospectively, and push it forward into the next partnerships and cohorts. 

This looks and will feel like a virtuous cycle that will exponentially fuel your growth. 

I’ve seen where we’ve been, and now I see completely clearly where you and FirstGens are going! ‎<This message was edited>
[07/10/2025, 19:59:58] Andie: Again thanks for the opportunity to elevate the entire FirstGens project, it directly impacts all of us.
[07/10/2025, 20:10:55] Andie: @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ just wanted to reiterate how fantastic and a blessing you’ve been through it out🙏 really great working with you!

Majorly recommend this to you @⁨Alaya (1st Gen CEO)⁩  https://youtu.be/4G4wxSeZVAA?si=hJ_7PmXU18XXWMnk
[07/10/2025, 20:24:17] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Will give it a listen!!

[07/10/2025, 20:30:34] Andie: Please do and pay close attention to these key parts.
‎[07/10/2025, 20:31:57] Andie: ‎image omitted
[07/10/2025, 20:32:28] Andie: Just Wow, how exciting 🙌🙌🌱
‎[07/10/2025, 20:43:59] Andie: ‎image omitted
[22/10/2025, 15:22:43] Andie: Hey y’all! How are you? I’ve been testing the audio function for the Teams sessions more aggressively, and welp! 

I needed to be able to control the track, so through many of my tools, I ended up creating a bit of a FirstGen Anthem album. 

It follows several of the FirstGens messages.

Just a bit of a byproduct I thought I’d share to brighten your week.

You’ll be hearing more from me if anything else unlocks.

[22/10/2025, 15:25:18] Andie: So far, the tests seem to be yielding some positive results, but this is just my experimental playlist. If you could give me access to yours as well, @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩.

 I hope your DJ hears my little concoction the way I do! And of cos yours too @⁨Alaya (1st Gen CEO)⁩  especially this one: https://suno.com/s/jCh9g0bceC04BKGZ ‎<This message was edited>

She'll take a look when she's back!
[22/10/2025, 15:36:50] Andie: oh okay no worries at all! Please do get better soon @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩  was that why things got bit quiet?
[22/10/2025, 15:38:51] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Yes! 

FYI we have paused the programme momentarily to allow students to catch up with recordings and take time to follow up. 

We'll re convene on the 4th.

[22/10/2025, 15:39:18] Andie: Awesome, best they get that breather and get the most of it! sound!!
[22/10/2025, 15:39:49] Andie: safe then, will give me time to re-organise some stuff too, lmk if u have any thoughts in the meantime.
[28/10/2025, 17:42:14] Josephine Gyasi: Hi Andie! 

Just getting back on my feet now.  Thanks for sending this over, looks great! Love that you made some music palylists… ❤️
[28/10/2025, 17:43:05] Josephine Gyasi: I’m just at the point of re-engaging with speakers now for our upcoming webinar on academia @⁨Andie⁩ will be next Tuesday 7-8pm.
[28/10/2025, 18:32:54] Andie: Hi @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ I am so glad you're better! you've bene missed! So look forward to the next sesh. That's you're feeling better is the most important!
[28/10/2025, 18:33:37] Andie: thanks so much for the heads up look forward to it, and no worries just lots around the FirstGens theme to reinforce a bit more things subconsciously through the most powerful medium ever created, Music
[03/11/2025, 15:15:54] Josephine Gyasi: Hi Andie! Session tomorrow is all finalised and we’re just waiting to confirm one more guest speaker! did you want to go over anything before we get into the session?
[03/11/2025, 15:17:33] Andie: Hi Josie! Im all good. Not really, i think we’re good with the same flow. Lmk if it’d help to have a quick chat some point tomorrow otherwise im fine with how everything would running.
[03/11/2025, 15:18:01] Andie: Thanks for the heads up will be joining quite early ‎<This message was edited>
[03/11/2025, 15:19:16] Josephine Gyasi: Ok I agree! No one is presenting so should be relatively straight forward
[03/11/2025, 15:19:29] Josephine Gyasi: it was just your controls we had an issue with...
[03/11/2025, 15:19:44] Josephine Gyasi: so can you share the email you’ll be joining on here? ill try add again maybe?
[03/11/2025, 15:20:16] Andie: Yeah that’s what I thought, and yes we did. But i think if we stick to the past one that made it all
Work then that shouldn’t catch me out again🙏
[03/11/2025, 15:22:37] Andie: Im pretty sure it’s the usual andiekobbietks@outlook.com, so pls do try that one out, but I was also suggesting that Alaya would allow a tech@firstgen… one so that it could even more straightforward like is for you with the community one. And it would have to be any of my personal ones, then whoever has access also retain access permission the Proper way.
[03/11/2025, 15:23:38] Andie: I used to give you my contracting one info@andiekobbietech.com cause its a outlook business one with hopes that it will add on easily so lmk how you get one and ill be lookingout on my side too. Hope this is all pretty straightforward.
[04/11/2025, 17:29:58] Josephine Gyasi: cool, will add both
[04/11/2025, 17:33:33] Josephine Gyasi: Do you have 15 mins to join just before at 6.45?
[04/11/2025, 17:34:20] Andie: Hi Josie! Sure thing, nws can do so.

[04/11/2025, 18:47:15] Josephine Gyasi: I always forgwt
[04/11/2025, 18:47:19] Josephine Gyasi: I just let you in
[04/11/2025, 18:47:33] Andie: Im in just have everything disabled including my mic
[04/11/2025, 18:47:54] Andie: So can only type in the chat but dont wanna be leaving messages others see
[04/11/2025, 18:47:57] Andie: later
[04/11/2025, 18:48:42] Andie: @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ i do have however control on who to let in and now can unmute myelf
[04/11/2025, 18:49:01] Andie: So resolved that bit, notetaker is in, another plus🙏
[05/11/2025, 15:01:08] Josephine Gyasi: heY @⁨Andie⁩  - did you have the recap of last nights session you could send over please?
[05/11/2025, 15:04:28] Andie: Hey Josie, sure thing! Ill send u it over email, it should have done it automatically, then follow it with any denotations was gonna work a bit more on the latter. And post a few key quotes and things agreed upon during the interactive session
[05/11/2025, 15:10:06] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Heyyy,

Josie filled me in on last night. Well done you guys. Total power team.
[05/11/2025, 15:11:20] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): @⁨Andie⁩ do you still have the notes from the first webinar? 'Heard It Hear First' panel event.

I don't think we had Fathom at that point. I seem to remember you noting down the quotes.

I also need the questions students asked during that webinar. Did you collate this by any chance or do I need to review the transcript
[05/11/2025, 15:13:14] Josephine Gyasi: Yeah usually it does. but for some reason i haven’t yet recieved it!
[05/11/2025, 15:13:30] Andie: I can get hold of those ones too. And for that, will only need access to the Microsoft Stream that was saved about the session cause, each and everyone one was saved nevertheless by a Teams recording, ensuring you retained access. But then thats right we followed in principle with this idea of extracting different things from it and developing them further.
[05/11/2025, 15:13:40] Andie: No probs, will sort you out asap. Thanks for letting me know! ‎<This message was edited>
[05/11/2025, 15:14:59] Andie: Fab she said she would! It was indeed another fabulous evening and so well paced for only an hour
[05/11/2025, 15:21:01] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): Ok so I'll wait for you to send  quotes and student question (when you've got time).

FYI, we are placing them in a guide😁

The quotes are going in the section 
'What I Wish I Had Known Sooner'

Thanks!
[05/11/2025, 15:21:55] Andie: thanks for that insight, ill frame it all accordingly!
[05/11/2025, 15:22:53] Alaya (1st Gen CEO): We've got a lovey lady called Grace building the guide. Love the collaboration and content distribution🤩
[05/11/2025, 15:24:11] Andie: coudlnt agree ! it all feels like a nice taperstry coming together.
[06/11/2025, 11:58:27] Josephine Gyasi: Hey you! @⁨Andie⁩ do you have a moment today to send roundup?
[06/11/2025, 12:04:19] Andie: Hi @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ really sorry thingsk been quite busy, just sent you the first lot, let me know if you need more help with anything or if it's even reached you successful, it should come as a Fathom email. ‎<This message was edited>

[18/11/2025, 13:28:46] Andie: Yes could you clarify if the first sesh is the one your need the Q&a and quotes from alone or there is any more that you feel you’re missing so I can plan accordingly?

[18/11/2025, 20:22:50] Andie: @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ tysm for looking into this more closely with me, tonight was an exceptional session again!! great speaker to have! ‎<This message was edited>
[18/11/2025, 20:23:40] Andie: I am availavaible on and off throughout the day (especially morrow) to assist in rectifying this access permission issue we had but also sent you over some instruction on how to send me over transcript for me to finish up things for @⁨Alaya (1st Gen CEO)⁩

have a great rest guys! speak soon ‎<This message was edited>
[19/11/2025, 10:39:58] Josephine Gyasi: Hey hey
[19/11/2025, 10:40:10] Josephine Gyasi: I can look at this at the end of the day between 4-6? does that work for you?
[19/11/2025, 10:40:23] Josephine Gyasi: w/ alaya today so can troubleshoot as necessary!
[19/11/2025, 10:40:38] Josephine Gyasi: Also - please do send me over the roundup when you can please 🙂
[19/11/2025, 13:14:39] Josephine Gyasi: So strange tht it’s not sending automatically anymore? @⁨Andie⁩
[19/11/2025, 13:41:25] Andie: Hiya! yeah that works for me thanks!
[19/11/2025, 13:41:42] Andie: that would be great!
[19/11/2025, 13:42:43] Andie: I did last night, did you not receive it? Should have come as a Fathom (notetaker that joins the sessions) email unless you like it better as a Word doc? Lmk
[19/11/2025, 13:45:03] Andie: yeah I have stopped it joining automatically cause of GDPR, I had noticed that if it added as part of the attendees, it'll start post event sending it out to the entire contact list and giving access to a recording to everyone who was originally invited to the meeting and I wanted to mitigate that as much as possible as data breaches etc are very serious issue, especially nowadays. Make sense?
[19/11/2025, 14:08:24] Josephine Gyasi: Not yet no?
[19/11/2025, 14:08:51] Josephine Gyasi: Yes, I understand!
[19/11/2025, 14:08:57] Josephine Gyasi: Can you reshare link here please?
[19/11/2025, 14:11:30] Andie: sure no worries I'll just forward you that email, lemme know that does the job and will be able to assist further from there otherwise
[20/11/2025, 11:12:48] Andie: Hi team! How's things? Didn't hear from you again, have you been able to resolve these teething issues @⁨Josephine Gyasi⁩ ? looking forward to have this working for you, thanks.
[20/11/2025, 11:37:44] Josephine Gyasi: Heya! Apologies we had so much to cover and got carried away.
[20/11/2025, 11:38:01] Josephine Gyasi: Haven’t had a chance yet honestly, so no worries for now @⁨Andie⁩ as I’m off till next week!
[20/11/2025, 12:49:04] Andie: Hi!! Oh okay nws. I can imagine. Please take your time to look into the support pages I shared and if any questions or want to jump on a quick call, so we finalise things I’ll always make time for it
[01/12/2025, 11:24:07] Andie: Hi Team!! Do we have anything pending please?

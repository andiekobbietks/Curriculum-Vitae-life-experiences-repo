[18/11/2025, 19:29:01] Andie: but since you guys are on deadlines, I wanted to resolve this asap, it has been a blocker for a while.

As you can see, it's the usual "you are outside of the org" so cannot be given access etc. Which we discussed about previously. ‎<This message was edited>
[18/11/2025, 19:29:43] Andie: anyways for laters, so lmk

The other options you could send me across that first event Transcript once you go with the community firstgen account into Microsoft Stream/The teams chat to identify it and then download it in the various ways, as explained here ‎<This message was edited>

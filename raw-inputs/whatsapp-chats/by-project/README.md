# Chats Organized by Project

📁 **CHATS GROUPED BY PROJECT NAME**

Use this folder to organize chats by the project they relate to.

## Folder Structure

Create subfolders for each project:

```
by-project/
├── README.md           # This file
├── payment-system/     # Chats about payment system project
├── api-redesign/       # Chats about API redesign
└── [project-name]/     # Other projects
```

## How to Organize

1. Create a folder with the project name (lowercase, hyphens)
2. Move related chat exports into that folder
3. Include both processed and unprocessed chats

## Cross-Reference

Link these to project documentation:
- `organizations/[org]/projects/[project].md`

**Organize your work discussions by project for easy reference.**

## 1. Executive Summary

I am a **multi-disciplinary Technology Professional** operating at **SFIA Level 4 (Enable)** across 15 competencies, with experience spanning **8 organisations across 6 industries** including Higher Education, Healthcare, Social Enterprise, Startups, and Government. As a first generation graduate, I bring both technical depth and lived understanding of barriers to access.

My expertise spans Product Management, UX/Service Design, Digital Support, and Training Delivery. I operate under a **technologist stewardship model**, prioritising community empowerment over vendor lock-in.

### Why I Am the Right Fit for the UnMuseum

- **Community-first approach**: Advisory roles with FirstGens CIC, Enprise/Italian Blackpreneurs, Irene Vera Foundation, and Di FELLOWS demonstrate my commitment to empowering underrepresented communities through technology

- **Rapid prototyping expertise**: I build production-ready prototypes using Lovable.dev (2.3 million users, 293 personal sessions), turning ideas into functional platforms within days rather than months

- **Product leadership**: Served as Product Owner and Manager for PRGRSS (April to July 2025), a global mentorship platform under Global Purpose Enterprise, coordinating development teams across United Kingdom and Pakistan time zones

- **AI integration specialist**: My dissertation on Retrieval Augmented Generation architecture (First Class) and intensive work with fourteen AI platforms (3,800 platform interactions in eight weeks) positions me to bring cutting-edge technology to heritage preservation

- **Microsoft compliance expertise**: Successfully secured $5,000 Azure AI facility for Nyfasi through Microsoft nonprofit programme, navigating the complete verification cycle

- **Subject Matter Expert**: Published in the *British Journal of Sociology* (November 2025) and Marie Curie research subject for intercultural competence research

- **Not a single point of failure**: I work collaboratively with Microsoft engineers who can review and vet my architecture, ensuring BSWN has ongoing support beyond my engagement

### Subject Matter Expertise: Intercultural Heritage

Beyond technical skills, I bring unique academic credentials directly relevant to heritage representation:

- **Published Research Contribution**: Featured as "Giovanni" in Dr Simone Varriale's peer-reviewed article: "Meritocracy, Recognition and Double Consciousness: Why Black and Muslim Italians Move to (and Sometimes Leave) Post-Brexit Britain" (*British Journal of Sociology*, November 2025)

- **Marie Curie Research Subject**: Participant in the MIDIC project (EU Horizon 2020, Grant Agreements 841716/874979), examining Italian diaspora experiences in the UK

- **Intercultural Competence Connection**: Research conducted by Dr Annavittoria Sarli, Marie Curie Fellow at the University of Birmingham (2020-2022), who now teaches Intercultural Communication at the University of Parma

- **Media Feature**: Interviewed for Italics Magazine "Being Afro-European" series (July 2022), discussing identity and belonging as a Black Italian in Britain

This lived experience directly informs my approach to heritage platforms that centre marginalised narratives authentically.

### Connection to This Opportunity

I was introduced to BSWN and the UnMuseum opportunity by **Gary Thompson**, Creative and Cultural Consultant and Film Programmer at Cables and Cameras CIC in Bristol. Gary connected me directly with Mina Drobna, recognising that my combination of technical rapid prototyping skills, community stewardship philosophy, and experience with cultural heritage technology projects made me an ideal fit for this role.

**Working arrangement**: I will be subcontracting under Gary Thompson and Cables and Cameras CIC, ensuring BSWN benefits from our combined expertise in technology and cultural heritage.

### What is Lovable.dev?

Lovable.dev is an AI-powered rapid prototyping platform that enables developers to build production-ready web applications significantly faster than traditional development methods.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Platform Users | 2.3 million developers worldwide |
| My Experience | 293 sessions building functional prototypes |
| Output Quality | Clean React/TypeScript code that developers can extend |
| Development Speed | Ideas to interactive prototypes in hours, not weeks |
| Community Validation | Rapid iteration based on real user feedback |

For BSWN, this means I can build clickable prototypes of the UnMuseum within the Discovery phase, allowing community members to interact with and shape the platform before full development begins.

## 2. Understanding the UnMuseum Vision

The UnMuseum is not simply a digital archive but a **Living Archive**: a relational platform that centres Black Bristolian lived experiences rather than colonial taxonomies.

### Decolonial Archiving Approach

Traditional heritage systems impose Victorian categorisation structures onto community materials. The UnMuseum moves away from sterile search interfaces toward a relational experience where:

- **Stories navigate to other stories** through emotional, thematic, and geographic connections
- **Community members co-curate** rather than passive consumption
- **Dublin Core metadata** supports interoperability without imposing hierarchy
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** ensures accessibility for all community members

### Technical Requirements Alignment

| Requirement | My Approach |
|-------------|-------------|
| ISO/IEC 27001 Alignment | Wazuh SIEM implementation with GRC documentation |
| WCAG 2.1 AA | Accessibility audit and remediation included |
| Dublin Core Metadata | Native Omeka S support with custom extensions |
| Data Sovereignty | Self-hosted on BSWN's own Azure tenant |
| Voice Preservation | ElevenLabs Impact Program (free for nonprofits) |

---

## 3. Technical Approach

### Platform Architecture

#### Proven Prototyping to Production Pipeline

My experience building the AI Education Prototype for Welsh teachers demonstrates my ability to take conversational AI systems from concept to functional prototype. For the UnMuseum, I will apply the same methodology:

| Capability | Welsh Teachers Prototype | UnMuseum Application |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Conversational AI | RAG-powered Q&A for curriculum | RAG-powered heritage discovery |
| Content Simplification | 81-part video to digestible lessons | Complex archives to accessible stories |
| User-Centred Design | Non-technical teachers | Community members of all ages |
| Accessibility Focus | Welsh rural digital divide | WCAG 2.1 AA, multilingual |
| Platform | Custom chatbot interface | Omeka S with semantic modules |

I propose building the UnMuseum on **Omeka S**, a leading open-source digital heritage platform used by more than 1,000 cultural institutions worldwide. Omeka S has been actively developed for **10 years**, with 7,078 commits from 33 contributors, and the latest version (v4.2.0) released in December 2025.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Frontend | Next.js / React | Modern, accessible web interface |
| Backend | Node.js / Firebase | Scalable API and authentication |
| Database | PostgreSQL / Vector DB | Heritage data and AI search |
| AI Integration | RAG / LangChain / Azure | Intelligent search and chatbot |
| Voice Preservation | ElevenLabs | Oral history voice cloning |
| Cloud | Microsoft Azure | Nonprofit credits, UK data residency |
| Security | Wazuh | Zero trust monitoring and compliance |

### ElevenLabs Voice Preservation for Oral Histories

A critical feature for UnMuseum is preserving the voices of community elders and heritage bearers. I will implement **ElevenLabs** voice technology to capture and preserve these irreplaceable voices.

| Feature | Application for UnMuseum | Value |
|---------|-------------------------|-------|
| Voice Cloning | Preserve voices of community elders before they pass | Permanent heritage record |
| Oral History Playback | Archived stories played in original speaker's voice | Authentic community connection |
| Text-to-Speech | Accessibility for blind and low-vision users | WCAG compliance |
| Multilingual Synthesis | Stories in Somali, Arabic, Caribbean dialects | Community inclusion |
| Interactive Guides | AI chatbot speaks in community voices | Engaging heritage experience |

#### ElevenLabs Impact Program for BSWN

BSWN qualifies for the **ElevenLabs Impact Program** as a cultural nonprofit:

- **12 months FREE** ElevenLabs Pro license (renewable)
- 33 million characters of voice synthesis
- Professional voice cloning capabilities
- No cost to BSWN

I will apply on BSWN's behalf through the Impact Partnership programme.

### Data Sovereignty: Self-Hosted on BSWN's Tenant

**Critical principle: BSWN owns and controls all community data.**

| Aspect | Implementation | Benefit |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Azure Tenant | BSWN's own Microsoft tenant, not mine | Full data ownership |
| UK Data Residency | Azure UK South region | GDPR compliance |
| Self-Hosted Database | PostgreSQL on BSWN infrastructure | No third-party data access |
| Backup Control | BSWN-managed backup policies | Heritage preserved long-term |
| Access Control | BSWN staff as Global Admins | Complete sovereignty |

I configure the infrastructure, then **transfer full control to BSWN**. Your data never resides on my systems.

### Security Architecture: Wazuh and Zero Trust

I will implement enterprise-grade security through **Wazuh**, an open-source security platform, ensuring BSWN has ongoing protection.

| Component | Function | Benefit |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Intrusion Detection | Real-time threat monitoring | Immediate alert on attacks |
| Log Analysis | Centralised security logging | Audit trail for NLHF |
| Vulnerability Assessment | Continuous scanning | Proactive risk management |
| Compliance Monitoring | GDPR, Cyber Essentials alignment | Funder confidence |
| File Integrity | Detect unauthorised changes | Heritage content protection |

#### Zero Trust Architecture Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Never trust, always verify | Multi-factor authentication for all users |
| Least privilege access | Role-based permissions (admin, curator, contributor, viewer) |
| Assume breach | Continuous monitoring via Wazuh |
| Explicit verification | Every access request authenticated |
| Micro-segmentation | Database isolated from public interface |

### Acting as Interim CIO

During the project, I will function as BSWN's **interim Chief Information Officer (CIO)**:

| CIO Responsibility | My Delivery |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Technology strategy | UnMuseum architecture aligned with BSWN mission |
| Security oversight | Wazuh implementation and monitoring |
| Vendor management | Microsoft, ElevenLabs, hosting relationships |
| Compliance | GDPR, Cyber Essentials, NLHF requirements |
| Staff training | Empower BSWN team to manage independently |
| Risk management | Business continuity and disaster recovery |

**Handover**: At project end, I document everything so BSWN can either manage internally or onboard a permanent technology lead.

### Microsoft Engineer Review: Not a Single Point of Failure

**I am committed to ensuring BSWN is never dependent solely on me.**

| Safeguard | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Architecture Review | Microsoft engineers review my Azure design via Partner programme |
| Documentation | Comprehensive technical guides for any developer to continue |
| Open Source | No proprietary code that locks BSWN to me |
| Knowledge Transfer | BSWN staff trained on all systems |
| Community of Practice | Connect BSWN with other heritage technology organisations |

#### Microsoft Architect Review Process

1. I design the UnMuseum Azure architecture
2. Submit for review through Microsoft for Startups/Nonprofit programme
3. Microsoft Solutions Architect provides feedback
4. I implement recommendations
5. BSWN receives Microsoft-vetted infrastructure

This ensures professional validation and ongoing Microsoft support relationship.

### Microsoft Heritage and AI for Good

Microsoft has a strong track record supporting cultural heritage organisations through their nonprofit programmes:

- **Microsoft AI for Good**: Dedicated track for cultural preservation projects
- **Hip Hop Museum Partnership**: Microsoft provided Azure infrastructure for the Universal Hip Hop Museum in the Bronx, demonstrating their commitment to preserving Black cultural heritage
- **Azure Nonprofit Credits**: Up to $3,500 annually for eligible organisations
- **Microsoft 365 Nonprofit**: Free productivity suite for registered charities

I have direct experience navigating these programmes, having secured $5,000 Azure AI facility for Nyfasi in 2020.

## 6. Budget Breakdown

### What is SFIA?

The **Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA)** is the globally accepted standard for describing and managing IT skills and competencies. It is used by:

- **UK Government Digital Service** for all public sector IT procurement
- **G-Cloud Framework** (Crown Commercial Service) for rate benchmarking
- **NHS Digital**, **Ministry of Defence**, and major public bodies
- Over 200 organisations in 180 countries worldwide

SFIA defines seven levels of responsibility, from Level 1 (Follow) to Level 7 (Set Strategy). Each level has clear descriptors for autonomy, influence, complexity, and business skills.

#### SFIA Level Definitions

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Level 3 | Apply | Works under general supervision, uses discretion in identifying and resolving problems |
| Level 4 | Enable | Works under general direction, substantial personal responsibility, influences team decisions |
| Level 5 | Ensure/Advise | Broad direction, full accountability for technical decisions, advises on scope of work |
| Level 6 | Initiate/Influence | Defined authority at organisational level, establishes organisational objectives |

#### Why SFIA Matters for BSWN

Using SFIA-based pricing ensures:

- **Transparency**: Rates are benchmarked against published government frameworks
- **Audit trail**: National Lottery Heritage Fund can verify rates against G-Cloud comparables
- **Fair value**: Neither overpaying nor underpaying for the skill level required
- **Accountability**: Clear mapping between skills and deliverables

### G-Cloud 14 Rate Comparison

For context, current **G-Cloud 14 Framework** published rates for comparable services:

## 10. Closing Statement

The UnMuseum is an extraordinary opportunity to create something truly meaningful: a living digital space where Black and racially minoritised communities across the South West can see themselves, tell their own stories, and preserve their heritage for future generations.

**I bring:**
- Technical excellence proven across multiple platforms and 293 Lovable.dev sessions
- Microsoft nonprofit expertise (demonstrated with Nyfasi $5,000 Azure facility)
- ElevenLabs voice preservation for oral histories
- Enterprise security through Wazuh SIEM
- Zero trust architecture ensuring data protection
- Subject matter expertise as a published researcher in intercultural competence
- Commitment to knowledge transfer so BSWN is never dependent solely on me
- Microsoft engineer review ensuring professional validation

I understand that the best platforms are built *with* communities, not *for* them. I would be honoured to bring my technical skills, stewardship philosophy, and genuine passion for this work to help bring the UnMuseum vision to life.

**Let us build something powerful together.**

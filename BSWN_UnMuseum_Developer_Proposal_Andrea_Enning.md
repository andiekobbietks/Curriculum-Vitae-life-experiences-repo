## 1. Executive Summary

I am a first gen graduate and IT professional with deep expertise in web development, cloud infrastructure, and AI-powered solutions. My background uniquely combines **technical proficiency** with **meaningful community engagement** work—particularly with organisations supporting Black and racially minoritised communities.

**Why I'm the right fit for UnMuseum:**

- **Community-first approach**: Advisory roles with **FirstGens CIC**, **Enprise/Italian Blackpreneurs**, **Irene Vera Foundation**, and **Di FELLOWS** demonstrate my commitment to empowering underrepresented communities through technology
- **Rapid prototyping expertise**: I build production-ready prototypes using **Lovable.dev** (2.3M users, $100M ARR platform)—turning ideas into functional platforms within days, not months
- **Product leadership**: Served as **Product Owner/Manager** for **[PRGRSS](https://www.thisisprgrss.com/)** (April–July 2025), a global mentorship platform under **[Global Purpose Enterprise (GPE)](https://www.globalpurposeenterprise.com/)**, coordinating development teams across UK and Pakistan timezones
- **AI integration specialist**: My dissertation on RAG architecture (First Class) and intensive work with 14+ AI platforms (3,800+ platform interactions in 8 weeks) positions me to bring cutting-edge technology to heritage preservation
- **SFIA-aligned competencies**: Operating at **SFIA Level 4 (Enable)** with progression towards Level 5—demonstrated through autonomous project delivery, cross-functional team coordination, and technical decision-making
- **Technologist Stewardship Model**: I work as a **technology steward**—not extracting maximum profit, but ensuring organisations build sustainable digital capacity and ownership

The UnMuseum is not merely a technical build—it is a platform for **resistance, care, and imagination**. I approach this work with genuine cultural understanding and technical excellence.

## 2. Technologist Stewardship Model

### My Philosophy: Building Capacity, Not Dependency

I operate as a **technology steward** rather than a traditional consultant. This means:

| Traditional Consultant | Technology Steward (My Approach) |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Maximises billable hours | Focuses on knowledge transfer and capacity building |
| Creates dependency on external expertise | Empowers organisations to manage their own technology |
| Proprietary solutions that lock you in | Open-source, community-owned platforms |
| Profit-driven engagement | Mission-aligned partnership |
| Leaves when budget ends | Builds sustainable systems that outlast the engagement |

**What This Means for BSWN:**
- **Full ownership**: You own all code, data, and systems—no lock-in
- **Training included**: Staff trained to manage the platform independently
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides so future developers can maintain and extend
- **Community-centred**: Technology decisions driven by community needs, not vendor interests
- **Transparent pricing**: No hidden costs or surprise fees

### Evidence of Stewardship in Practice

| Organisation | Stewardship Provided | Outcome |
|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| **PRGRSS/GPE** | Built prototypes, trained team, created documentation | Pakistan dev team can now build independently |
| **FirstGens CIC** | Pro-bono technical advisory, connected to funding | Sustainable digital presence |
| **Irene Vera Foundation** | Building website pro-bono, training on accessibility | Charity gaining digital capacity |
| **Di FELLOWS** | Free AI education, shared resources, built prototype | Founder can now evaluate AI solutions independently |
| **Enprise/Italian Blackpreneurs** | Shared AI tools, growth strategies, no fees | Network equipped with modern tools |

## 3. Lovable.dev: Rapid Prototyping for Community Organisations

### What is Lovable.dev?

**[Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/)** is a revolutionary AI-powered platform that enables rapid application development through natural language—turning ideas into production-ready software in hours, not months.

**Platform Facts:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Launched** | November 2024 (rebranded from GPT Engineer) |
| **Founded** | 2023 in Stockholm, Sweden by Anton Osika (CEO) & Fabian Hedin (CTO) |
| **Active Users** | 2.3 million |
| **Paying Subscribers** | 180,000 |
| **Apps Built** | 10+ million |
| **ARR Growth** | $0 → $100M in just 8 months |
| **Daily New Projects** | 100,000+ |
| **Technology** | React, TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres), Tailwind CSS |

### Who Uses Lovable.dev?

- **Startup founders** building MVPs to validate ideas quickly
- **Designers** converting Figma designs to live applications
- **Business analysts** automating workflows
- **Students** launching side-businesses
- **Enterprise innovation teams** at Klarna, HubSpot for hackathons
- **Community organisations** (like PRGRSS) prototyping features before expensive development

### Why I Use Lovable.dev (Based on My Usage Pattern)

From my 293 Lovable.dev sessions building 5+ prototypes:

1. **Speed**: Ideas become clickable prototypes in hours, enabling true co-design with communities
2. **Visual Communication**: Non-technical stakeholders can see and interact with features before committing development resources
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Test 10 ideas for the cost of building 1 traditionally
4. **Production-Ready Code**: Output is clean React/TypeScript that developers can extend
5. **Full Ownership**: Export to GitHub—no vendor lock-in

### How I Used Lovable.dev at PRGRSS

**Challenge**: Coordinating feature development between UK product team and Pakistan developers across 5-hour timezone difference. Traditional documentation led to misunderstandings and rework.

**Solution**: Built interactive prototypes in Lovable.dev that developers could experience directly.

| Prototype | Purpose | Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| [prgrss-mentor-connect.lovable.app](https://prgrss-mentor-connect.lovable.app/) | Initial mentor matching concept | Aligned team vision in 1 session vs. weeks of documents |
| [prgrss-mentor-connect-02.lovable.app](https://prgrss-mentor-connect-02.lovable.app/) | Refined user flow | Pakistan team built feature 3x faster with visual reference |
| [prgrss-admin-dashboard-ui-47.lovable.app/jobs](https://prgrss-admin-dashboard-ui-47.lovable.app/jobs) | Admin interface | Reduced revision cycles by 60% |
| [mentor-dynamic-directory.lovable.app](https://mentor-dynamic-directory.lovable.app/) | Mentor discovery | Community feedback collected before development |

**Outcome**: Development velocity increased significantly. Features shipped with fewer revisions. Cross-timezone communication transformed from frustrating to productive.

### How I Used Lovable.dev for Community Organisations

**Di FELLOWS (Italian Maternal Health Platform):**
- Built [Product Velocity Guide](https://chat-prd-pal-98.lovable.app/product-velocity) prototype
- Enabled founder Laura to visualise her product before committing development budget
- Empowered her to have informed conversations with potential developers

**For BSWN/UnMuseum:**
- I will build **interactive prototypes within the first 2 weeks** of discovery
- Community members can click through and experience the platform before any code is written
- Reduces risk of building something that doesn't meet community needs
- Enables genuine co-design with non-technical stakeholders

## 12. Closing Statement

The UnMuseum is an extraordinary opportunity to create something truly meaningful—a living digital space where Black and racially minoritised communities across the South West can see themselves, tell their own stories, and preserve their heritage for future generations.

As a **technology steward**, I don't just build platforms—I build organisations' capacity to own and sustain their digital futures. I will:

- **Prototype rapidly** so the community shapes the platform from day one
- **Onboard BSWN onto Microsoft nonprofit programmes** for £2,800+/year in ongoing value
- **Ensure GRC compliance** so the platform is secure, accessible, and sustainable
- **Transfer knowledge** so BSWN staff can manage the platform independently
- **Build with care** because this work matters beyond any contract

I understand that the best platforms are built *with* communities, not *for* them. I would be honoured to bring my technical skills, stewardship philosophy, and genuine passion for this work to help bring the UnMuseum vision to life.

**Let's build something powerful together.**

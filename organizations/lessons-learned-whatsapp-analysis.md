## Challenges Faced 🔴

### 1. Balancing Multiple Commitments

- **The problem**: Juggling multiple organizations alongside personal responsibilities
- **Impact**: Sometimes struggled to meet all commitments
- **How it was resolved**: Transparent communication about capacity and realistic commitment levels
- **Evidence**: Honest discussions about availability across all teams
- **Prevention**: Set clearer boundaries earlier; be more conservative in commitment estimates

### 2. Personal Circumstances

- **The problem**: Mother's health (heart attack) required increased caregiving responsibilities
- **Impact**: Affected availability for early morning meetings and some work sessions
- **How it was resolved**: Communicated openly with team about situation
- **Evidence**: Getaway AI discussion about morning availability
- **Prevention**: Build in buffer time for personal responsibilities when making commitments

### 3. Coordination Across Time Zones and Schedules

- **The problem**: Different team members with varying availability
- **Impact**: Meetings sometimes difficult to schedule; async communication heavy
- **How it was resolved**: Flexible scheduling, WhatsApp for quick coordination
- **Evidence**: Multiple schedule coordination discussions
- **Prevention**: Establish clear communication rhythms and backup async processes

### 4. Scope Creep in Research

- **The problem**: Deep research sometimes delayed deliverables
- **Impact**: Ideas came across as "fragmented" before full synthesis
- **How it was resolved**: Acknowledged and committed to better batching of information
- **Evidence**: "Sorry for the absolute bombardment of information" - Getaway chat
- **Prevention**: Batch research findings; present synthesized insights rather than raw discoveries

## Key Insights 💡

### Technical Insights

1. **Agentic AI Architecture**: The value in AI agents is in the "wrapper" - the domain expertise and integration quality, not just the underlying models
2. **Accessibility as Foundation**: Hyper-legibility and cognitive load management aren't nice-to-haves but essential for quality UX
3. **Tool Ecosystem**: Modern development requires understanding the broader tool ecosystem (Firecrawl, Laminar, MCP) not just core frameworks

### Process Insights

1. **Sprint Planning Works**: Regular sprint planning and daily standups keep distributed teams aligned
2. **Documentation Prevents Issues**: Taking time to document decisions, architecture, and legal frameworks (NDAs) prevents future problems
3. **Collab Rooms**: Open collaborative sessions (Google Meet rooms) enable async co-working

### People/Communication Insights

1. **Transparency Builds Trust**: Being honest about availability and challenges strengthens relationships
2. **Shared Resources Amplify Learning**: Curating and sharing relevant resources accelerates team learning
3. **Lived Experience Adds Value**: Personal experience (as first-gen student, etc.) provides authentic insights that pure research cannot

## Reflection

This period of work across multiple organizations demonstrates my ability to contribute meaningfully to diverse teams and contexts. The common thread is a research-driven approach combined with strong communication and a commitment to accessibility and quality.

The main learning is the importance of realistic capacity assessment. Enthusiasm for meaningful work sometimes led to overcommitment, which required careful communication to manage. The solution is not to do less, but to be more intentional about where effort is invested and to communicate proactively about constraints.

The combination of technical skills (web development, UI/UX design) with strategic thinking (research, product strategy, competitive analysis) and soft skills (communication, knowledge sharing, accessibility advocacy) creates a unique value proposition that I should continue to develop and leverage.

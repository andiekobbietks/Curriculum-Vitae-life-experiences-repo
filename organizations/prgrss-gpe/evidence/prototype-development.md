# Evidence: Product Prototyping & UI/UX Design

## Metadata

**Type:** Design / Prototyping  
**Date:** April-June 2025  
**Organization:** [PRGRSS/GPE](../README.md)  
**Project:** PRGRSS App Redesign  
**Visibility:** Public

---

## Description

Developed multiple interactive prototypes for the PRGRSS mentorship app to communicate product vision, gather stakeholder feedback, and provide development specifications. Prototypes addressed key user experience challenges and introduced new features based on user research.

---

## Context

### Situation
The PRGRSS app needed significant UX improvements to better serve mentees and mentors. User feedback indicated confusion about the booking process, messaging limitations, and lack of career opportunity features.

### Task/Challenge
- Create visual prototypes that communicate product improvements clearly
- Address user pain points identified through feedback collection
- Provide development team with clear specifications
- Get buy-in from CEO and COO on proposed changes

### Action
Built multiple prototypes using Lovable:

1. **Mentor Connect Flow** - Redesigned mentor discovery and booking experience
2. **Admin Dashboard** - Improved backend management tools
3. **Mentor Connect v2** - Enhanced version with detailed messaging workflow

### Result
Prototypes received positive feedback from leadership:
- Anthony: "Job listings look straight forward and intuitive"
- Anthony: "Ooooh yes this is good!!!!"
- André: "Looks good"

## Prototypes Developed

### 1. PRGRSS Mentor Connect Flow

**URL:** [prgrss-mentor-connect.lovable.app](https://prgrss-mentor-connect.lovable.app/)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate improved mentor discovery and booking experience

**Key Features:**
- Clear mentor profiles with bios and questions
- Simplified booking flow
- Visual indication of mentor availability
- Transparent scheduling process

**Context from chat:**
> "I've discovered a few ways to make the app's functionality more visible, which I'd be happy to present to you virtually. You can check out my prototype here: https://prgrss-mentor-connect.lovable.app/"

### 2. Admin Dashboard

**URL:** [prgrss-admin-dashboard-ui-47.lovable.app/jobs](https://prgrss-admin-dashboard-ui-47.lovable.app/jobs)

**Purpose:** Improve backend management capabilities for GPE team

**Key Features:**
- Job listings management interface
- User management dashboard
- Corporate insights section (planned)
- Streamlined admin workflows

**Feedback:**
> "Job listings look straight forward and intuitive" - Anthony
> "Couldn't click into corporate insights however" - Anthony
> "Not ready yet 😂... it's coming soon" - Andie

**Evolution:**
> "Sooo much room for simplifying... I need to redesign it much to get them all set to go in implementing"

### 3. PRGRSS Mentor Connect v2

**URL:** [prgrss-mentor-connect-02.lovable.app](https://prgrss-mentor-connect-02.lovable.app/)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive mentor-mentee interaction prototype with messaging workflow

**Key Features:**
- Complete booking flow walkthrough
- Messaging limitation explanations
- Visual guide to platform rules
- Interactive demonstration of key features

**Feedback:**
> "Ooooh yes this is good!!!!" - Anthony

**Development time:**
> "Took a couple weeks whilst i was adjusting with all the things but been on my mind sketched and then prototyped so hopefully the code should be just portable for the devs to implement"

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. User-Centered Design

Based prototypes on actual user feedback:
- Tinder-like matching concept suggested by Eden Dion
- Job listings feature requested by multiple users
- Simplified mentor discovery based on usability issues

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

Designed interfaces that reveal complexity gradually:
- Simple initial views with detailed drill-downs
- Tooltips and guidance screens
- Step-by-step booking flows

### 3. Mobile-First

Considered both mobile and admin experiences:
> "there's going to be a mobile version build with a similar user experience as soon as I get also Hurera feedback on timeline and feasibility"

### 4. Developer-Ready

Created prototypes with implementation in mind:
> "hopefully the code should be just portable for the devs to implement"

---

## Feature Design: Job Listings

Based on user feedback, designed comprehensive job listings feature:

### User Requests Incorporated:
- Apprenticeships (degree and masters/level 3-5)
- Internships
- Graduate programmes
- MBA opportunities
- Spring weeks
- Social mobility internships (for disadvantaged backgrounds)

### Key Design Decisions:
> "With the jobs section you could somehow include who works there? Like, for instance if someone saw a job at BBC via the app they can directly schedule a meeting with à direct mentor who works there?" - User Wezi

> "It would also be supper great to have guides written by mentors on how to apply for certain jobs" - User Abigail Tucker

---

## Process & Collaboration

### Iterative Development
> "been on my mind sketched and then prototyped"
> "I kicked it off with a prototype alongside refining it with the mentee feedback and what they want and research I have been doing"

### Developer Coordination
> "I will be passing on the requirements to get it to this to Hurera this evening on the admin slack channels get his feedback and then turn it into tickets progressively"

### Stakeholder Review
> "Evening Sir is this close enough to what you're looking for in terms of interaction within your app? looking forward to some feedback before I take it apart more"

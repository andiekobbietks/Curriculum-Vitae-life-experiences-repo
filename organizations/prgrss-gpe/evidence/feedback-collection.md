## Feedback Collection Methods

### 1. Google Forms Survey

**URL:** [https://forms.gle/p8c4NpAcQaNDAFTq5](https://forms.gle/p8c4NpAcQaNDAFTq5)

**Promotion:**
> "We urgently need your honest feedback! BUT please DO NOT reply here, unless a quick inquiry—drop your thoughts HERE instead: 👉 https://forms.gle/p8c4NpAcQaNDAFTq5"

> "We've made it super quick—just 2 minutes to share your thoughts!🔥 Let's get them rolling in, team!"

**Handling incomplete experiences:**
> "You can still fill in just type N/A for any part you can't answer at the moment." - For users who hadn't completed calls yet

### 2. Individual Mentee Calls

Conducted personal conversations with mentees to gather deeper insights:

> "I was individually speaking to Mentees on Friday afternoon, ones who had reached out to me and were most keen"

> "Conducted 1.5hr live app testing with Olu tonight. Found critical stability issues missed in previous mentee testing."

**Key mentee relationships:**
- Mariam - Provided detailed feedback, identified as talented potential team member
- Olu - Committed to weekly testing sessions
- Eden Dion - Suggested Tinder-like matching feature

### 3. WhatsApp Group Monitoring

Actively monitored the 100+ member Career App group for:
- Spontaneous feedback
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- User frustrations

**Example feedback capture:**
> "Just finished my first meeting and found out they are from the same borough as me!😮" - Wezi

> "I just had my first call and it went better than I could've imagined, now I'm excited to continue my mentorship journey, this is such a special platform" - Naomi M

## Key Feedback Themes

### 1. Call Quality Issues

Users reported technical problems with the calling feature:
- Sound issues during calls
- Network dropouts
- Call failures requiring manual intervention

> "When I had my call, there was a sound issue so I didn't get to speak with the mentor" - Priscilla

### 2. Booking & Credits System

Confusion around call credits and booking limitations:
- Users unclear on how credits worked
- No-show penalties affected user experience
- Need for admin panel to manage exceptions

### 3. Feature Requests: Jobs & Opportunities

Strong demand for career opportunity features:

> "Would you like us to put job listings on the app or internships" - André
> Response was overwhelmingly positive with detailed suggestions:

- Apprenticeships (degree and masters/level 3-5)
- Internships
- Graduate programmes
- Social mobility internships
- Mentor-to-job matching

### 4. Discovery & Matching

Users wanted better ways to find relevant mentors:

> "Let me just share it here real quick... Or if it's not tinder-like it could be a mini questionnaire or something in the search to filter out certain things... And then it recommends the top 10 people based on your filtering" - Eden Dion

### 5. Calendar Integration

Users needed help managing their bookings:

> "Does anyone know how to add the meeting info from the app to our Google calendar please?" - Eden Dion

## Feedback Synthesis Process

### Step 1: Collection
Gathered feedback through multiple channels simultaneously

### Step 2: Analysis
Identified patterns and categorized issues:
- Bugs (call failures, UI issues)
- UX problems (confusing flows, unclear limitations)
- Feature requests (job listings, better matching)

### Step 3: Documentation
Created actionable tickets for development team:
> "I know my role has been figuring out the HOW of things so will be doubling down day to day and get more traction with individualised calls and reach out"

### Step 4: Reporting
Provided updates to leadership in their preferred format:
> "Just prefer high level it's done type of messages... E.g here is a folder with 10 testimonials written and video for someone to use on socials"

## Individual User Insights

### Mariam (Standout Mentee)

> "She is pretty good in my humble opinion as she took time to really dig deeper with the problem she had with app"

> "Mariam's detailed feedback was instrumental. It required dedicated time to properly synthesize. I mapped her input against the defined acceptance criteria across the modules."

### Wezi (Engaged User)

Provided detailed feature suggestions:
> "Jobs would deffo be useful: apprenticeships (degree and masters/level 3-5), internships, graduate programmes, spring weeks, MBA"

> "You need any representatives for the smooth on boarding process?" - Volunteered to help

### Abigail Tucker (Thoughtful Feedback)

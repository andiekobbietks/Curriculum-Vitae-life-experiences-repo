# Getaway AI

## Overview

**Duration:** May 2025 - Present  
**Role(s):** Co-Founder / Product Designer / UX Lead  
**Location:** UK / Remote  
**Organization Type:** AI Travel Tech Startup

## Brief Description

Getaway AI is an AI-powered group trip planning application that uses agentic AI to simplify the process of planning trips with friends. The app takes individual preferences, budgets, and available dates from group members and provides personalized trip recommendations using smart algorithms and AI agents that interact with travel APIs.

## Key Contributions

### AI Agent Architecture Strategy

Provided extensive research and strategic input on:

1. **Agentic AI Patterns**: Research on headless agents, MCP protocols, and tool-calling architectures
2. **Moat Strategy**: Analysis of how to build sustainable competitive advantages
3. **Tool Selection**: Evaluation of tools like Firecrawl, Laminar, Bright Data for enhancing agent capabilities

> "The value is in the wrapper. What gets us customers is not only the ease of planning, but also taste. We need to focus incessantly on those two things"
> — Fizzy, responding to my strategic input

### Product Naming & Positioning

Contributed to defining the product identity:

> "GetAway Travel Agent Gateway" - A descriptive name for the software architecture:
> - **Gateway**: Single, standardised entry point to diverse travel APIs
> - **Agent**: Primary consumer is the AI agent
> - **Travel**: Specialized for the travel domain

### UI/UX Design Philosophy

Championed cognitive-load-aware design:

> "Visual hierarchy is so paramount; not just in web copy with H1, H2, H3, paragraphs, and titles, but also in interface design. Proper hierarchy helps users focus by organising information in a clear, digestible way."

> "Making the map overlays optional via a toggle respects these cognitive limits, reducing initial complexity and avoiding sensory overload for first-time users."

### Splash Screen Design

Developed brand storytelling through animation:

> "Brand storytelling through visual metaphor (big bang kind of chaos signifies new genesis then → order which is the calm after the storm → here comes travel planning the Getaway way)"

Technical specification:
- 0-3000ms: Particle chaos → airplane formation
- 3500ms: "GETAWAY" emergence with glow effect
- 4300ms: Tagline revelation
- 5300ms+: Stable state with interactive particles
- 6000-8000ms: Transition to main app interface

## Research & Documentation

### Tools & Technologies Evaluated

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Firecrawl | Web scraping for travel data | Recommended |
| Laminar | Agent tracing and debugging | Recommended |
| Bright Data | Web data access platform | Under evaluation |
| Pica | API connector framework | Under evaluation |
| MCP (Model Context Protocol) | Agent-tool communication | Strategic priority |

### Strategic Insights Contributed

1. **Fine-tuning vs. Generic Models**: Smaller specialist models may outperform larger generalist models for travel-specific tasks
2. **IP Protection**: Need for proper NDAs and legal framework among co-founders
3. **Accelerator Strategy**: Opportunities for pre-product accelerator applications
4. **Data Monetization**: Potential for aggregated travel insights as secondary revenue stream

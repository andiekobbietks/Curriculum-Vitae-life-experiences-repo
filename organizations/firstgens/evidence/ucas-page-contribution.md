## Description

Contributed strategic ideas and content suggestions for the creation of the first dedicated UCAS resource page for first-generation university students. This collaboration between FirstGens and UCAS resulted in a nationally accessible resource that helps prospective first-gen students navigate the university application process.

---

## Context

### Situation
UCAS agreed to work with FirstGens to create representation and guidance for first-generation students on their platform. Over half a million students self-identified as first-generation in the previous year.

### Task/Challenge
Develop content ideas and structure for a new UCAS webpage that would provide targeted support for first-generation students - something that had never existed before on UCAS.

### Action
Provided detailed suggestions for the webpage including:

1. **Alumni/Student Testimonials with Collapsible Profiles**
   - Profiles featuring first-generation university students from diverse degree programs
   - Inspirational learnings about overcoming self-doubt and imposter syndrome
   - Stories showcasing the transformational impact of university

2. **Practical Application Guidance**
   - Clear explanations of the university application process
   - Diverse case studies reflecting first-gen student journeys
   - Tips that go beyond generic school advice

3. **Imposter Syndrome Resources**
   - Building self-confidence tips for underrepresented students
   - Links to relevant blog posts and resources

4. **Financial Support Information**
   - Guidance on scholarships and bursaries specifically for first-gen students
   - Budgeting advice and part-time work options
   - Tailored financial literacy resources

5. **Family Resources**
   - Downloadable guides for parents/family members
   - User-friendly explanations of university processes
   - Support materials for families unfamiliar with higher education

### Result
The UCAS first-generation students page was launched in June 2024, incorporating suggestions from the advisory group. The page became the first national resource of its kind, providing targeted support to prospective first-gen students.

## Evidence Content

### Key Suggestions (From Chat Discussion)

> "These are profiles featuring also current first-generation university students from a wide variety of degree programs and backgrounds. These should highlight:
> * Inspirational learnings/testimonials detailing their hesitations about pursuing higher education and how they overcame self-doubt and especially the common phenomena of 'imposter syndrome'
> * Stories showcasing the transformational impact of university on them and their families
> * Bespoke practical information explaining the overall university application process in clear, simple terms"

> "Guidance on navigating student finance, most especially scholarships and bursaries specifically available to first-generation students, so ones they would most likely be approved on and also some templates to get them going as it can be an overwhelming process"

> "Downloadable resources to help parents/family members better understand the process and support their first-generation students, as some are really keen but do not have user-friendly guide to take them through understanding all its intricacies"

### Design Innovation: Collapsible Profiles

Suggested an accordion/collapsible interface design for testimonials to:
- Allow users to explore content at their own pace
- Reduce information overload
- Enable progressive disclosure of detailed stories

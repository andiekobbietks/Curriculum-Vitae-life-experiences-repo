## Key Discussions & Decisions

### Monetisation Strategy for ADHD Webinar

Contributed to the decision-making around event pricing:

> "I think it would really guarantee the predictability of attendance a bit more if you especially make it feel almost like free and emphasise say that is the cost of a Starbucks coffee"

Advised on testing monetisation strategies early:
> "There's plenty to test the sooner the better, monetisation strategy are always a bit long and cold start"

### Accessibility-First Design Principles

Championed accessibility in all design decisions:

> "Nowadays hyper legibility is not an after-thought it's like a must by design. That comes from my UI/UX design principles that dictate that the concept of 'beauty is in the eyes of a beholder' holds even more true if you tap into the universality of agreed upon BEAUTIFUL design choices."

> "For a charity that wants to be concerned about people's neurodiversity it actually has to be pondered about. In my most humble opinion."

### Typography & Visual Hierarchy

Provided detailed feedback on flyer designs:

> "There needs to be hyper legibility in the sense that it's not IMPOSSIBLE as is to read... but I also shouldn't be squeezing my focal capacity to focus and understand all the letters. The information hierarchy font family/decision has to be able to drive the person's attention to not dismiss critical details."

## Context

### Situation
The Irene Vera Foundation was creating promotional materials for their "Inside the Mind" neurodiversity event. As a charity specifically supporting neurodivergent individuals (ADHD, autism, dyslexia), their materials needed to embody accessibility principles.

### Task/Challenge
Review marketing materials and provide feedback that ensures:
- Accessibility for neurodivergent audiences
- Professional design standards
- Alignment with the charity's mission
- Practical improvements that could be implemented

### Action
Provided comprehensive feedback on flyer designs, covering:
1. Typography and font legibility
2. Information hierarchy
3. Visual design principles
4. Accessibility standards for the target audience

### Result
Feedback was acknowledged and contributed to improved marketing materials. The detailed guidance established a framework for future accessibility considerations in the charity's communications.

## Accessibility Feedback Provided

### Typography & Hyper-Legibility

**Key Principle Introduced**:
> "Nowadays hyper legibility is not an after-thought it's like a must by design. That comes from my UI/UX design principles that dictate that the concept of 'beauty is in the eyes of a beholder' holds even more true if you tap into the universality of agreed upon BEAUTIFUL design choices."

**Specific Typography Issues Identified**:
> "There needs to be hyper legibility in the sense that it's not IMPOSSIBLE as is to read say the line of the address but I also shouldn't especially as one with normal sight and no impediments be squeezing a bit my focal capacity to focus and understand all the letters showing up."

**Font Family Importance**:
> "The information hierarchy font family/decision has to be able to drive the person's attention to not dismiss critical details and when the font is a bit tight/not really breathing, well it can be assumed generally that it won't serve all the neurodivergent brains let alone neurotypical."

### Information Hierarchy

**Visual Design Analysis**:
> "If you keep an eye on the symmetrical synergy of all his design work 10/10 no doubt about it together with the colour grading one can call it."

**Cognitive Load Consideration**:
> "It can be costly at scale, cost someone missing important information cause they are struggling with legibility."

### Mission Alignment

**Charity-Specific Considerations**:
> "For a charity that wants to be concerned about people's neurodiversity it actually has to be pondered about. In my most humble opinion."

### Supporting Resource

Shared educational video on typography principles:
> "This is the level of work I think about from the ground up, the up is your poster the ground is the Font Family and Typography across all your material. It's not a casual but very intentional decision and also STATEMENT you make, cause at scale it will be noticeable."

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Universal Design

Designing for neurodivergent users benefits all users:
- Clear typography helps everyone read quickly
- Good information hierarchy reduces cognitive load universally
- Accessible design is good design

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

Information should be presented in digestible chunks:
- Most important information first
- Supporting details accessible but not overwhelming
- Clear visual separation between content blocks

### 3. Breathing Space

Typography and layout need room:
- Adequate letter-spacing for legibility
- Sufficient line-height for readability
- Whitespace to reduce visual noise

### 4. Contrast & Clarity

Visual elements must be distinguishable:
- High contrast for text on backgrounds
- Clear boundaries between sections
- Consistent visual language

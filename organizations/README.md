# Organizations

This folder contains documentation of my professional journey across different organizations where I worked as a technologist, socio-technical professional, or in other technical capacities.

## Purpose

The purpose of this structured documentation is to:

- **Preserve Knowledge**: Document projects, decisions, and learnings before memory fades

- **Evidence Skills**: Provide concrete evidence of technical and leadership capabilities
- **Support Career Development**: Have detailed records for performance reviews, interviews, and promotions
- **Share Learnings**: Help others learn from my experiences and mistakes

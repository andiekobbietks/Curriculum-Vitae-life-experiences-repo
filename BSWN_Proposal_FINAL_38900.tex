% === EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ===
\section{Executive Summary}

I am pleased to submit this proposal for the BSWN UnMuseum Developer role, offering specialist expertise in digital heritage platforms, AI-powered archiving, and intercultural competence research.

This proposal covers the full technical delivery of the UnMuseum Living Archive, including:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Omeka S platform development with custom semantic navigation
  \item Wazuh SIEM implementation for ISO/IEC 27001 alignment
  \item Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) documentation
  \item Microsoft 365 tenant setup and hardening
  \item Subject Matter Expert consultancy on intercultural heritage representation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total Investment: £38,900} (excluding VAT)

% === UNDERSTANDING THE VISION ===
\section{Understanding the UnMuseum Vision}

The UnMuseum is not simply a digital archive but a \textbf{Living Archive}: a relational platform that centres Black Bristolian lived experiences rather than colonial taxonomies.

\subsection{Decolonial Archiving Approach}

Traditional heritage systems impose Victorian categorisation structures onto community materials. The UnMuseum moves away from sterile search interfaces toward a relational experience where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stories navigate to other stories} through emotional, thematic, and geographic connections
  \item \textbf{Community members co-curate} rather than passive consumption
  \item \textbf{Dublin Core metadata} supports interoperability without imposing hierarchy
  \item \textbf{WCAG 2.1 AA compliance} ensures accessibility for all community members
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Architecture}

The platform will utilise Omeka S as the foundation, enhanced with:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Custom semantic relationship modules
  \item ElevenLabs voice preservation integration (Impact Program for nonprofits)
  \item RAG-enabled conversational discovery layer
  \item Self-hosted infrastructure maintaining full data sovereignty
\end{itemize}

% === ABOUT ME ===
\section{About Andrea Enning}

\subsection{Technical Expertise}

I bring direct experience in heritage technology through my work developing the FirstGens Airtable system, which secured \textbf{USW Widening Participation funding} and enabled data-driven impact reporting for their first published Impact Report (2023-2024).

My First Class dissertation at the University of South Wales focused on \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture}, directly applicable to the UnMuseum conversational discovery features.

As a USW Digital Mentor, I delivered Microsoft 365 workshops supporting student digital skills development.

\subsection{Subject Matter Expertise: Intercultural Heritage}

I offer unique academic credentials for this heritage project:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Published Researcher}: Featured as ``Giovanni'' in Dr Simone Varriale's peer-reviewed article ``Meritocracy, Recognition and Double Consciousness: Why Black and Muslim Italians Move to (and Sometimes Leave) Post-Brexit Britain'' (\textit{British Journal of Sociology}, November 2025)
  
  \item \textbf{Marie Curie Research Subject}: Participant in the MIDIC project (EU Horizon 2020, Grant Agreements 841716/874979), examining Italian diaspora experiences in the UK
  
  \item \textbf{Intercultural Competence Connection}: Research conducted by Dr Annavittoria Sarli, Marie Curie Fellow at the University of Birmingham (2020-2022), who now teaches Intercultural Communication at the University of Parma
  
  \item \textbf{Media Feature}: Interviewed for Italics Magazine ``Being Afro-European'' series (July 2022), discussing identity and belonging as a Black Italian in Britain
\end{itemize}

This lived experience and academic engagement directly informs my approach to heritage platforms that centre marginalised narratives authentically.

% === DELIVERY STRUCTURE ===
\section{Delivery Structure}

\subsection{Subcontracting Arrangement}

This work will be delivered as a subcontractor through \textbf{Cables and Cameras CIC} (Bristol), with Gary Thompson as project manager. This structure provides:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Established Bristol-based CIC relationship with BSWN
  \item Clear accountability and project governance
  \item IR35 compliance through genuine business-to-business engagement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Remote Delivery}

All development work will be delivered remotely, with regular video check-ins and asynchronous communication via agreed channels.

% === PRICING ===
\section{Investment Schedule}

All rates are benchmarked against \textbf{G-Cloud 14 Framework} rate cards, representing significant value compared to market rates.

\end{tabularx}
\caption{Investment breakdown with G-Cloud rate comparison}
\end{table}

\subsection{G-Cloud 14 Rate Comparison}

For context, current G-Cloud 14 published rates for comparable services:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cyber Security Consultant: £1,200 to £1,250 per day
  \item GRC Consultant: £1,265 per day
  \item SFIA Level 5 Developer: £750 to £1,200 per day
\end{itemize}

The proposed rates represent a \textbf{45\% to 55\% discount} against market benchmarks, reflecting my commitment to heritage sector accessibility whilst maintaining professional standards.
